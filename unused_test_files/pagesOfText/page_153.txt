Pattern 10
White to p lay, Black d ies
There is a defe ct on the left side of Black's
shape.  How should  White punis h him for
this? Keep  your  eye on the shortage  of liber-
ties of the three stones formi ng the roof  of
Black's positio n.
Solution 1. The  center  of three stones.
As it says in the proverb,  'the center of three
stones  is the vital  point;  so the placement  at
Whit e 1 is a good  move . After Black 2, craw ling
at White 3 is inten ded to lead Black into a
shortage  of liberties. After Black  4, Wh ite cuts  at
5 and  Black  can't atari  on the white stones  on ei-
ther side.  This is a beauti ful sequen ce.
Solution 2. The  open connection
In answer  to White  1, if Black  makes the open
connection at 2, White  cuts deci sively at 3. Once
again,  because  of a shor tage of liberties, there is
noth ing Black  can do.
Failure 1. A vulga r move
Cutti ng at 1 is vulgar. After Black 2 and
Whit e 3, Black descends  to 4 a nd is alive.
If Black hurriedly tries to make eye shape  by
playi ng 4 at 'a', then  White throws in at 4 and
gets a ko.
