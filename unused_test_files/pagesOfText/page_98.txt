Variation 2. Turning  the tables
Black recaptures  at 5. When White conn ects
underneath  at 6, Black catches White  in his own
shortage  of liberties, so Black  lives.
Variation 3. N o answ er
Even if White plays  atari  at 1, can't do
anyth ing. Black blocks at 2 and whe n White
captures  at 3, Black  can simply  connect at 4.
Even  if Whit e fills in at 'a', Black  can squeeze at
'b', thanks  to th e extra liberty  on the outside.
Failure. Ten- thousand-year ko
After White 1 to 3, what  about  carrying  on
with  4 and 6 as in the prev ious pattern?  This
may  be a relatively easy  ko for Black  to fight ,
because  of his outside  liberties, but comm on
sense  tells us that living with a seki is superior
to a ko.
Reference. Short age of liberties
Let's compare  the positio n once again  with
the pattern in which Black  is short of liberties.
In this case, after White 1 to 3, attaching un-
derneath  at Black  4 doesn  t work  When Whit e
connects outside  with  9, Black cannot play  the
atari  at 'a' b ecause of his shortage of  liberties.
