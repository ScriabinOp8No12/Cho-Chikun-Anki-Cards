Failure 2. The  vital point
Answering White 1 with the jump  to 2 is a
good  move,  as this turn s out to be the vital
point  after all.
Well, in this positio n is Black alive or not?
We have to pur sue this  a littl e bit further.
Failure 3. Aliv e
If any mov e will work, it's probably the
attachment at White 1. After  Black  2, White
plays  atari at 3, but Black  connects at 4 and
is okay.  White 5 is met by a black capture  at
6 and Black just manages  to make eyes. Even
if White play s 3 at the atari of 5, Black
answers  at 6 and gets the same  result  In this
positio n, Blac k is alive.
Failure 4. Vulgar
The belly attachment at White 1 has to be
called a vulgar  move. After Black  2 and
Whit e 3, the jump to Black  4 is important
After this, Black  lives with  White 'a', Black
'b', White 'c', Black 'd'. If Black uses  4 to play
atari  at 'b',  White plays  a hane  at 4 a nd gets a
ko, so be  careful .
Failure 5. An awfu l play
Pushi ng down with Whit e 1 is an even
worse  way to play Black defends  at 2 and
the shape  is exactly  the same  as in Pattern
17, so it's a living shape.  If White plays  a
hane  at 3, Black conn ects at 4.
