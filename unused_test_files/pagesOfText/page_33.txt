Pattern 13
Black to play and live
The black stones stretch out from  the cor-
ner to the left and right It looks  as if Black
has room  enough to live, but he'll need to
pay attentio n to the complex ities of the cor-
ner. 
Note, too,  that the shape  is symm etrical. 
Solution. The 1-1 point
Follo wing the proverb,  Play in the middle
of a symmetrical shape,'  Black  1 on the 1-1
point  is correct  It should  be quite obv ious that
Whit e has no place from  which to launc h an
attack
You  might well wonder  if there  isn't  any
other  way to live.  The fact that there isn't  is
the main  theme of this  pattern . 
Failure 1. D efect
Based  on the shapes we've covered  so far,
the descent  to 1 seems to be the most  natural
play  How ever,  there is a major flaw in this
move.  
The  steps  White must take to penalize
Black  for his mistake are also very important,
so we'll  discus s them in the diagrams  which
follow
Failure 2. Ko
What  if White starts with  a hane  at I? This
is in fact a bad play,  but Black's  defense,
blocking at 2, is also a mistake. The resul t to
this point leaves  White with the attachment at
3. Black  4 an d White 5 th en yield a ko.
