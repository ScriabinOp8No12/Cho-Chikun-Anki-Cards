Pattern 17
Black to play and make a ko
This looks  like a shape you migh t see in
actual play.  It's similar  to the previous  pat-
tern, but you should  note  carefully that the
outs ide libert ies of Black's two stones  have
been  filled in. As might  be expected,  the
stones can no longer live unconditionally.
Solution. The open  connection
In this shape,  playing a hane at 1 and
answeri ng White's block at 2 with the open
connection of Black 3 is the only  possibility. In
response  to White's atari at 4, Black  blocks at 5
and White 6 starts a ko fi ght.
Reference 1. Black  lives
In the previous  diagram,  White has no choice
but to fight the ko, but let's suppose he connects
at 1. What  happens?
Black can simply  hane  and connect at 2 and
4. When  White captur es at 5, B lack conne cts at 6
and has a living shape.  Conse quently, unless
Whit e is totally  unable to fight the ko, White  1
is strange.
Failure 1. Atar i
Lets  take  a look  at Black  1, the move  which
allowed  him to li ve in the previous  pattern.
After White 2, Black  tries the technique of
Black  3 to 5. This  time,  howe ver, White cuts at 6
and puts the two black stones in atari. Next,
after  Black  'a' and Whit e 'b', Black is dead.
