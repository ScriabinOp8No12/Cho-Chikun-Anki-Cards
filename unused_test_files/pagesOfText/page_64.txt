Pattern 9
White to p lay and make a ko
Black hanes have been added  to both
sides of the black group,  making it even
more  tenaciou s. White, if it's his turn,  will
be successful if, rather than  uncon ditionally
killing Black,  he g ets a ko.
Solution. Attachment and place ment
White should  play  the attac hment at 1.
When Black plays  2, White's  block at 3, fol-
lowed by Black 4 and  White  5, giv es a ko.
Instead  of 1, a placeme nt at White 3 is also
a vital  point Next,  with Black  2, Whit e 1 and
Black 4, we return to the same  shape as be-
fore.
Failure 1. Cannot  link under
After White 1 and Black 2, the descent  at
White 3 aims  to kill Black unconditionally,
but because  of the presenc e of the marked
black stone,  it does n't work  in this shape.
That  is, Black responds calml y at 4 and the
two white stones can't link under. If Black
connects at 'a' instead  of 4, then White 'b'
kills him.
Failure 2. An awful move
White's throw-in at 1 cannot be called  a
good  move. Whe n Black captures  at 2, there
is no way  to make  a nakade inside the black
group. I f Whit e tries 3, Black answers  at 4.
Also, if Whit e plays 1 at 'a', Black  'b' is a
good  move.  This sequen ce has already been
explained in the last pattern.
