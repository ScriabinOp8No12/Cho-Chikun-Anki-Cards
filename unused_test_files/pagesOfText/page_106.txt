Pattern 7
White to p lay and make a ko
Compa ring this to the previous  pattern,
Black has an extra liberty on the right side.
What can White do now,  if it's his turn?  If
you refer to the previous  diagram, the an-
swer will prob ably come to you.
Solution. Begin with the place ment
This time  you start with the white  place-
ment  at 1. Turni ng at 2 is Black's  best de-
fense  and then he answers  White 3 by
throw ing in at 4. In this position, after
White 5, Black  could  switch elsew here if he
chose to, but after  that,  White 'a', Black 'b',
White 'c' would  produce  a true ko. So, as it
stands, it's a one-step appr oach- move ko.
Variation. A true ko
As you are already well aware,  answer-
ing White 1 by attac hing at Black 2 also
gives a ko. This  time, howev er, it's immedi-
ately a real ko, so for Black the prev ious
diagram is bette r; conse quently, Black  2 is
something of a defe nsive mistake.
Failure. Alive
What about attach ing at White 1? This
time, howe ver, the defens ive move at Black
2 is play able. The extra liberty at 'a' has
prove d to be an important  difference be-
tween this pattern and the previous  one.
