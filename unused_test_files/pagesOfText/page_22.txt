We've added a hane (the marked black  stone)
to the previous diagram. It appears that Black's
situation  has improved  markedly However, the
fact is nothing has changed . Just like before,  if
it's Whit e's turn, Black  dies. 
Reference 2. Same idea
Just as before  White 1 is good  enough.  If
Black  connects at 2, White throws in with 3. If
the marked Black  stone  were not present,
Whit e's throw-in at 3 w ould simply  be a hane at
3; regardless, Black is dead. Conti nuing, next
Whit e answers Black  'a' by extend ing inside to
'b'.
Likew ise, should Black play  2 at 3, White
plays  at 2. 
Reference 3. Place ment
After White plays 1, if Black  blocks  at 2,
Whit e again makes the placement at 3. Next,  if
Black  'a', White 'b', or if Black 'b', Whit e 'a. In ei-
ther case, it is apparent  that Black's hane is use-
less.  
Referen ce 4. Alive
In this case as well, begi nning with the place-
ment  at White 1 is a mistake.  After 4, Black is
alive. 
Likew ise, should Whit e begin  by throw ing in
a stone  with Whit e 1 at either 2 or 3, Black  gets
life after captur ing at 1.
