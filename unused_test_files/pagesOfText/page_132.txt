Pattern 26
White to p lay, Black d ies
This time  a white descent at the marked
stone has been added. This is a variatio n of
Pattern 24, but at the end Whit e has an
exquisite play  that  puts  an end to all of
Black's resistan ce.
Solution 1. Eff ective
This  time  White 1, 3, and 5 become
effective. After the cont inuation to White
9, Black  10 has already been  introduced
as a good  move  for Black This time,
howe ver, because  of the presence  of the
marked  white stone,  White has an even
nicer play availa ble to him.  That move is
show n next...
Solution 2. Att achment
Whit e plays the attachment at 1. After
Black  2, White  captures  at 3. Black
captures  a stone  by playing at the 1-1
point  and then  White recaptures  with  5 at
3. At that point, the marked  white stone
filling in Black's liberties  makes its
presence  felt, as Black  is unable  to
squeeze  because of a shor tage of liberties.
The position becom es a bent  four  in the
corner.
Failure. Ko
If White makes the ordinary  mov e of 1,
Black  block s at 2. White can then  fill in
Black's  liberty with 3, and it becomes  a
ko, but this,  of course,  isn't as good as the
solution.
