Pattern 10
White to p lay and get a k o
This shape  woul d have  to be called, the
corner 'comb' shape.  White has various
means  of attacki ng it, and they  all lead to
ko. This shape com es up often  in actual
play, so you should  learn it wel l.
Solution 1. Hane and placement
The first solutio n is the hane  of Whit e 1, fol-
lowed,  whe n Black  blocks  at 2, by the place-
ment of White 3. Black has no choice but to re-
sist by attach ing at 4; in answer  to White 5, he
sets up ko w ith 6.
If Black plays  4 at 5, Whit e crawls to 4 and
Black is dead.
Failure. Omission
Simply  making the placement at White  1
omits a step in the proce ss. Whe n Black play s
2, followed  by White 3, the cut at 4 is a good
move. Whe n Whit e captures  at 5, Black  plays
atari at 6. The result here  won't  be a big eye.
For that to happen,  White first needs  to make
the exchange of White `a', Black  'b'.
Solution 2. Belly attachment
The second solutio n is the belly attachment
at White 1. After Black  plays a han e at 2, Whit e
craw ls to 3, then  answers Black 4 by descend-
ing at 5. In order to avoid  a big eye, Black is
force d to throw in at 6, making a ko. If White
wins the ko fight,  he will captur e at 'a', giving
him good aji.
