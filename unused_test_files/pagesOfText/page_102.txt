Failure 1. Ko
After White 1 and  Black 2, cutti ng
immediately at Black  3 doesn't work  Black
goes  all out with 4 and starts  a ko fight  If
Whit e uses 5 to extend  to 'a', Black  answers
at 'b'  and  it's still a ko.
Failure 2. Aliv e
It seems  as if White should  be able to
attach  at 1 and  kill Black,  but, after  4, Black is
alive. Black 6 is a good answer to White 5. If
instead  Black blocks with 6 at 'a', White kills
him by playing  at six  and making a big  eye.
Also, if Whit e use 5 to hane at 6, then
Black  will live with the diagonal  play at 5
(albeit in seki) .
Reference 1. An ext ra liberty
Here  Black  has one extra liberty at 'a'.
Now,  even  if Whi te plays first, the resul t is
no longer  certain  death for Black.
Whit e plays 1 to 3, then  tries  5, but now
only  gets a ko. Additionally, you  should
verify for yourself  that,  if White begi ns with
1 at 3, then  follo ws the proc edure of
answeri ng Black  4 with the placement of 6,
Black  can play  at 'b'  and  live.
Reference 2. Ko
Whe n Black  has an extra  liberty,  the
correct  proc edure for White is to turn at 1.
Black  has no choice but to block at 2 and
answer  White's cut at 3 by going all out with
4 to make a ko.
