Failure 2. Diagonal play
What happens  if Black  makes the
diagona l play  at 1, trying  to expand  his
base? Figuring  out how  White should  attack
this shape is also difficult The final result  is
a ko, but if White plays  poorly,  Black  will be
able to live. How should  Whi te play? The
other  pattern s of this type  should provide
you with reference  material.
Failure 3. Ko
White's throw-in at 1 produc es a ko. The
fact that Black  4 produces  a two- step ko has
been  explai ned previously.
If Black  makes  the open connection at 'a'
instead  of 4, White cuts at 'b' and once again
gets a ko.
Failure 4. Placement
The placemen t at White 1 is at the vital
point, but it doesn't  work with this shape.
After Black 2 and White 3, conn ecting at
Black 4 is a good move.  Even if White  aims
to make a big eye with White 5 to 7, Black
connects at 8 and all White gets is  a seki.
Instead  of conne cting at 4...
Failure 5. Sudden dea th
Crawling with Black  1 is suicidal. The
poor  move of Black 1 reduces Black's own
libert ies. Now,  after Black  3, three  black
stones can be placed in atari with White 4 to
6. When  White  plays  atari  at 6, Black
captur es at 'a', then  White 'b' produces  a
three- space  big eye.
