Pattern 3
Black is dead
This shape  often appears  in actual play
and is know n as the 'L-shape'.  Even if it is
Black's turn, he cannot live with one move.
If you learn this shape  thoroughly it'll be
easier for you to understand  its various ap-
plications.
Variation 1. Turning
Let's look  at a number  of possibi lities for
Black  1.
First,  there  is the 'turn' at 1 here, The place-
ment  at White 2 becomes the vital point  The
moves  to 6 give  Black a big eye (one  large eye
inside his positio n), so he  is dead.
White can also begin  with 2 at 4.
Variation 2. The  jump
Next  is Black's  jump  to 1. This is the move
which looks  as if it has the best chance of suc-
ceedin g, but Whit e 2 is at the vital point on the
other  side. Up to Whit e 6, Black again fails to
make more than  one eye.
Variation 3. D iagonal play
What about Black's  diag onal play  at 1? Un-
fortunatel y White's place ment at 2 is at the vital
point,  and there is not enough  room to make
two eyes. B lack 'a' is answered  by White 'b'.
White 2 is absolutely the vital point  Play ing a
hane  at 'c' instead lets Black live by play ing at 2.
