Pattern 6
White to p lay and make a ko
A hane has been added to Black's  posi-
tion in the previous  diag ram, and,  as might
be expected,  it is no longer possib le to kill
the blac k group out right
The prob lem is White's first move , as
there  are a number  of ways to go astray.
Solution 1. Throw -in
The throw-in of White 1 is the move which
punis hes Black  for his ugly shape. In response ,
making  an eye with 2 is Black's best defense, so
with  White 3 it becomes  a ko .
Furtherm ore, in this fight, once  Whi te has
recaptured  the ko...
Reference. A local  ko
Black can connect at 1, but after Whit e
answers  at 2, nothing has chan ged: it remains a
ko fight Still, Black  can use 1 as an internal ko
threat.
Variation 1. A comm on technique
What happens  if, when  White play s 1, Black
captures  at 2? In this case, the placement at
Whit e 3 becomes  the vital point  and Black dies
unco nditionally Whit e 5 is a common  technique
in this situation. The continuation of Black  'a,
Whit e 'b' is a dead  shape that  has come up
many  times befor e. Interesti ngly enough,  even
if Black answers 3 at 'a' instead  of 4, White still
plays  5.
Solution 2. The  follow-up?
