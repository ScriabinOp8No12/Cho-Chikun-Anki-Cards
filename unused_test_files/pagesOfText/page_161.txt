Pattern 15
Black to play and live
This can be cons idered  a practi cal appli-
cation of our analysis so far. There  is a po-
tential blind spot  in this shape,  so be sure
you read  it out accur ately to the very  end.
The various  failure diagrams of this pattern
are also of interest
Solution. Jum p
As has appeared several times, the jump
to Black 1 is the correct play  The attachme nt
at White 1 is annoying, but Black  can simply
connect at 3. In answer  to White 4, Black
takes a stone  with 5.
If White switches 2 to 4, Black  conn ects at
'a'.
Failure 2. Block ing
Common  sense may say to block at 1, but
why  do you thi nk it's no good?
It's because  White has the cut at 2. When
Black  play s atari  at 3, White descend s to 4,
and Black,  short  of liberties on both  sides,
cannot pres s.
Failure 2. In  actua l play
After Black 1 and White 2, Black tries  to
play  atari undern eath at 3, but after  Whi te 4,
Black  is forced  to captur e at 5. With  the
throw- in of White 6, Black  collapses.
In an actual game,  it would  be very  easy
to answer  autom atically at Black 1, so you
need  to b e careful.
