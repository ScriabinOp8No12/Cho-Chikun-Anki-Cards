Pattern 25
White to p lay and make a ko
In this  shape,  deciding where White
should make his first move  can be a little
confusing. You need  to return  to your  basic
approach  to life and death  prob lems.  You
should also be carefu l about how Black will
defend .
Solution. Throw -in
One  of the fundam entals of life and death is
reducin g from the outside. The throw- in of
Whit e 1 adheres  to that  principle. For Black,
connecti ng solidly  at 2 is the best  response,  then
the hane  at W hite 3 yields  a ko.
If White plays  1 at 2, Black  will connect at 1
and live. Onc e again,  l is the vital point.
Variation. Unconditional
After White 1, capturi ng at Black 2 is a
defens ive mistake. White's attachme nt at 3 is a
good move  and after Black 4, Whit e descend s to
5, destroying  Blac k's eye at ' a'.
Should White play 3 at 'b', Black  conne cts at 4
and lives.
Failure. Descent
The descent to 1 is often a good  move, but in
this case it lets Black  play at 2 and make  two
eyes.  If instead  of 2, Black connects at 'a', White
can attach  at 'b', producing a sudden death for
Black,  so h e mus t also be careful .
Addit ionally, if White uses 1 to attach  at 2,
Black  plays at ' b' and lives.
