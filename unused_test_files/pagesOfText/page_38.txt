Solution 4. No way to live
If Black  play s at 1 to avoid  the capturi ng
race in the previous two diagrams,  White' s
hane at 2 kills  him. Needless to say it is use-
less for Black to conti nue by play ing at `a',
as the result is bent  four in the corner.
Failure 1. Mistake at White 5
After White 1 through  Black 4, the thrust
upwar ds at White 5 is a mistake. Black
hanes at 6, and now  even  if White cuts at 'a',
Black will make  two eyes at 'b'. Be caref ul of
the slight difference betwe en this result and
that of Solution 1.
Failure 2. Simplicity
Going  back to the begin ning, you might
wond er about  the hane of White 1, but, as
might be expected, such  a simple  play  will
not kill the black group.
Black 2 turns  out to be the vital point
Even if Whit e conti nues at 'a', Black  blocks
at 'b' and is alive.
Failure 3. A mediocre move
Blocking at White 1 is an even  worse
play . Black play s 2, or, as we saw in Pattern
14, makes eye shape with Black  'a'.
