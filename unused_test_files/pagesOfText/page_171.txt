Pattern 23
White to p lay and make a ko
This is similar to the previous  pattern, but
to see what  is differe nt, you should  turn  the
page back and  compa re them.
There is no way to kill this shape uncon-
ditionally, so m aking  a ko will be a success.
Solution 1. Throw  in
This  time,  as you might  expect,  the throw-in
at White 1 is the correct move.  Black  is forced  to
capture  at 2 and  White then  blocks with 3.
After this, what type  of ko it becomes
depends  on how Black defends,  so let's take a
look  at some of  the variations.
Solution 2. Two- step ko
After the last diagra m, the open conn ection
at 1 is Black's  best move.  White captures  at 2
and starts a ko fight, but even  if he wins this ko,
Whit e cannot  end the ko fight After Whit e 'a',
he still needs to captur e at 'b'. In other words,
it's a two- step k o.
Variation 1. Tight connection
If Black connects tight ly at 1, natural ly White
makes  the place ment at 2 After Black 3, White
captures  at 4 and  makes ko.
This  is a direct ko, so making  the two-step ko
as in the prev ious diagram  is more  favorable
for Black
