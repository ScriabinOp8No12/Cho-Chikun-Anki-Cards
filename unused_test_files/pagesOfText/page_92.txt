Failure 3. Unconditional death
After Black  1 and Whit e 2, cutting White
off from  the outside with Black  3 leads to an
unconditionally dead shape.  White can
crawl at 4 and when  Black  conne cts at 'a ,
White will play  'b'.
On the other  hand,  if White plays 2 at 4,
then  Black  will ham at 2 and is absolutel y
alive.
Failure 4. The 2-1 paint
Wha t about jumping down  to Black 1?
This is also one of the vital  points  for the life
or death  of this  group;  howe ver,  after
White's hane at 2, Black loses his flexibility
White will answer Black 3 at 4, so Black is
dead .
Furthermore, if White  first plays  2 at 4
and Black  plays  'a', White 2 also  kills him.
Failure 5. The diagonal play
Black's diagon al move  at 1 also hits at the
2-1 vital point,  but it won't allow Black  to
live. White will hane  at 2 and then  after
Black 3, the attachme nt at 4 becomes  a good
move . Next, B lack plays 5, W hite connects at
6, and Black's 'eye'  at 'a' comes  unraveled.
White can also play 2  at 4 if he wishes.
Failure 6. A foolish play
Black's connection at 1 is the least
effective of all the possibl e plays.  White
plays a hane at 2 and there is not enough
room  in which to live. Next,  if Black play s at
'a', White answers at 'b'.
In addition to this,  a black effort which
begins  with the descent  to 'c' is also quickly
ended by a white hane at 2
