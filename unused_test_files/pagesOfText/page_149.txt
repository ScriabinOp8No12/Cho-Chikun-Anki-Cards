Pattern 7
White to p lay and make a ko
One of the teeth on the left side of the
com b shape  is missing, and Black's shape  is
imperfect The ques tion is how  to take ad-
vantage  of this. There  are a number  of pos-
sibilities for the first move, so latch ing onto
the solutio n may prove  difficult.
Solution 1. Att aching
Atta ching at White 1 has a good  feel to it and
in fact is the best way  to approa ch this position.
Black  has no choice but to resist by attach ing
underneath  at 2 and then  to answer  White  3 by
connecting at 4, making a ko. Needless to say, if
Whit e wins  the ko fight, he will connect at 2,
making  a big eye.
Reference. The surr oundings
In the previous diagram,  there  is one thing
you must be  carefu l about
I'd like to warn  you  about the position
resulti ng from Black's playing 1 and 3 to
capture  the four  stones. The prob lem is the
presence  of the marked  white stone. If it were
not there, after White play s inside the black
positio n, there  is some  reason  to fear that Black
could  escape  by playi ng at 'a'.
Variation 1. D eath
You  also need  to read out the variation  in
which, following White's attachment at 1, Black
connects at 2. Of cour se, descend ing to 3 is
forced.  After Black  4 and  6, W hite turns  at 7 and
now,  even if Black plays  'a', it's not a seki
because  of the cutting point at 'b'. Black  is dead.
