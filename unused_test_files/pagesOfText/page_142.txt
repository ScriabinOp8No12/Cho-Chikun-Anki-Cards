Failure 1. The  genuin e article
The hane of White 1 is totally unima ginative.
Black  descends to 2, yielding a perfect exam ple
of the comb  formation, so he's alive. After this,
even  if White  tries to get a big eye, 'a' and 'b'
become  miai, so Black  lives.
Failure 2. Two- step ko
What about  beginning by cutting inside with
Whit e 1? At first this looks like a tesuji, but it's a
little too tricky.  After Black 2, Whit e can try the
maneuver  of playing atari at 3, but the ko fight
resulti ng from  Whit e 5, Black 6 is not a real ko,
but a two- step ko instead. This  is, of course, not
as good as getting  a direct  ko.
Whose  turn to start the ko
In the problem in Diagram 1, suppose  it's
White's turn  to play The solutio n is, of course,
a ko.
Is it good  enoug h for White to simply  play  1
and let Black  take the ko at 2? It certain ly is a
ko, but there is a problem  with this. Strictly
speaking, White must play  the sequence of
White 1 to 3 in Diagram 2 This  is beca use, as
you  must have noticed, it now becom es
White's turn  to take the ko first
Should  Diagram 1 be cons idered  a correct
solution? There is no rule for this in life and
death  problems,  but even  if we do decide  to
call it a solution, you should remember that it
is not as good as the result  in Diagram 2.
