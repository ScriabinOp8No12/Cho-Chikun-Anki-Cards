Pattern 29
White to p lay and make a ko
This time  the position is open  at the base
from the other  side.  It appe ars that no mat-
ter how White  plays,  Black is alive. The
small-knig ht move  doesn't  work the large-
knig ht mov e doesn't  work but White has a
third  option.
Solution. Attach ment
White attaches  at 1, answers  Black 2 with a
hane  at 3, and in a response to Black 4, there  is
room  to go all out by starting  a ko with 5. If
Black  contin ues at 'a', White 'b', Black  'c', and
Whit e 'd' follow Black can use these  moves as
ko threats, but there  can certa inly be no doubt
that this  is a real  ko.
Failure 2. An i mportant sequence
Sliding in with the large- knight move  at
Whit e 1 leads now here.  For Black, first playi ng
2, then  turning to 4 is an important  seque nce.
After this it's obvi ous that even if White next
plays  'b', Black can play 'a' and  live.
If Black  plays  2 at 4, White plays  at 2 and this
reverts  to the  prev ious diag ram.
Failure 2. Sma ll-knight  move
Sliding in with the small -knigh t move  at 1 is
dubious.  Black simply makes  the diagonal
move  at 2 and, after  White  3, the empty triang le
of 4 makes  this revert  to the last diagram.  Just
for referen ce, after  this, White 'a' is met by
Black  'b', then White 'c', Black  'd', Whit e 'e',
Black  'f', and White 'g' lead  to a seki and life for
Black.
