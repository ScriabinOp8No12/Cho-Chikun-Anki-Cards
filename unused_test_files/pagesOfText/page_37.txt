Pattern 15
White to p lay, Black d ies
This looks  similar  to the last pattern, but
White hasn't  blocked at 'a'. Black looks  to be
com fortably alive, but if it's White s turn,
there  is a vital  point in Black's position that
he can aim at.
Solution 1. The 2-1 point
Whit e 1 is the killing point Black has no
choice but to expand  his eye space;  from
Black 2 to 6 is a one- way street  At this
point, White 7 is a good  move.  If Black
plays 8, Whit e cuts  at 9, and since Black
suffers from  a severe shortage  of liberties,
this shape  is hopeless for him.
Solution 2. One eye versus no eye
At Black  8 of the previous  diagram,  what
if Black connects at 1? In that case White
descends at 2. White  now has one eye and
Black none,  so after Black  'a' and White 'b',
Black loses the capturin g race and dies be-
cause of a shortage  of liberties.
Solution 3. Same result
Wha t about  if, after  White  1, Black  ex-
pands his eye space from the other  side
with 2 and 4?
Next, Whit e's diagona l play  at 5 is
important After Black  6, White 7,
connecting at the shoulder, Black 8 and
White 9 give the same result  as in the
prev ious diagram.
