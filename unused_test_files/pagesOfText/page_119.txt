Pattern 16
Black is alive
In this shape  Black has played  a hane
ahead  of time. This  single hane becomes  of
great  assistanc e to Black  Even if White gets
to make the first play  here,  there  is nothing
he can do. Howe ver, if Black  is not careful
about how  he defend s, sudden  death is a
possibility.
Variation 1. C omposure
One  of the strong plays that White can make
is the throw-in at 1. In response, turni ng at
Black  2 is a steady  answer  Next,  even if Whit e
plays  at 'a', trying to make big eye, Black plays
'b'. If White descends to 'c' instead, Black lives
by playing 'b'. Either  way, the marked  black
stone  makes i ts pres ence felt.
Failure. Unthinking
In response  to White 1, captur ing at Black 2 is
thoughtl ess. White  makes the placement  at 3
and now  we have the dead shape which pre-
vious ly appea red on page 102.
Capturing  at 2 doesn't  give the marked  black
stone  a chance to do any  work.
Variation 2. Frightening
The placement at 1 is also  a strong move.
Once  again, Black  2 is the vital point;  when
Whit e descends  to 3, Black blocks at 4. Whe n
Whit e throws  in at 5, for an insta nt Black might
think he is dead,  but simply captur ing at 6
secures  life: if White 'a', Black 'b' leave s Black
alive.
