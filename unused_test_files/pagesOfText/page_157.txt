Pattern 12
White to p lay and make a ko
On the left, White has played  down to the
edge of the board and the position has be-
com e somewha t intricate. Howe ver, there  is
only  one vital point  If Whit e plays  there, a
ko natural ly follows.
Solution 1. Placement
As shown in the diagram, the placement
at White 1 is the vital point  If Black conn ects
at 2, White cuts at 3. When Black  plays atari
at 4, Black goes  all out w ith 5 and  gets a ko.
Whit e's attaching with 3 at 5, trying to
connect  underneath,  ends in failure  after
Black conne cts at 3.
Solution 2. Connectin g on the opposite side
In response  to White 1, Black  can also use
2 to connect on this side. As before,  White
cuts at 3 and answers  Black's  atari at 4 with
a hane at 5 to make a  ko.
Additionally, Black's  effort to live uncon-
ditionally instead  of taking the ko with 6 is
shown in the following diagrams.
Variation 1. Captur ing four stones
Rather than playing a ko, Black  plays
atari at 1. White  connects at 2 and Black
captur es four ston es with 3, but is he really
alive? Consider the next  diagram.
