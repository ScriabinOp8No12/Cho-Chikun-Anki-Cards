Pattern 6
White to p lay, Black d ies
The location of the bulge  has shifted to
the right side.  For White, deciding where  to
put the first stone in this position can be
somewhat troublesome.
Solution 2. Begin  with a hane
In this shape, begi nning with the white  hane
at 1 is correct. If Black  blocks at 2, White's play
at the vital point  of 3 comes  immediately to
mind.  After Black  4 and  White 5, Black is dead. 
If Black blocks with 4 at 5, it should be appar-
ent that White  s insertio n at 4 turns this into a
false  eye.
Solution 2. Throw -in
What about if, after White 1, Black plays at 2,
to assure  himse lf of one eye in the corner? In
that case  the throw-in at 3 works. This makes
miai of 'a' and 'b': (Black  'a', White 'b' and vice
versa)  Instead  of 3, a white extensio n to 'b' will
also kill Black.
Failure. Wrong timing
White 1 really looks  like the vital point,  but
playi ng it immediately fails. Black lives with  2
to 4. He could  also live with Black 2 at 3, fol-
lowed  by White 2, Black 'a', White 4: this  is seki.
The trick  is to begin with a hane, then  play at
the now -obvious vital  point.
