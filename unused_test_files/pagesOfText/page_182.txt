Pattern 31
Black to play and live
Beca use he has an open  liberty  at 'a', the
Black group  can be saved. The quest ion is
how  to connect that open  liberty to life for
the group.
Solution. Open connecti on
Making the open conne ction on the left
side at 1 is good enoug h. When White  plays
2, Black 3 secures  two eyes. Even if White
plays 2 inside at 3, Black descends  to 2 and
has no trouble  whatsoever
Failure 1. Opposite directi on
What about  making the open  connection
on the right side at Black  1? White will
throw  in a cut at 2 and,  since Black  has no
choice but to answe r at 3, make use of the
atari  at 4 and hane at 6 to kill the group.  In
short, the open conne ction of Black  1 doesn't
make us e of the open  liberty at 'a'.
Failure 2. Descent
Lets  try descendi ng to Black  1. Unfortu-
nately,  with a whit e hane at 2, Black is easily
killed. White can answer  Black  3 with the at-
tachment at 4.
Also, desce nding on the other side at 1 is
met by a white placeme nt at 3 and there  is
no way  for Black to li ve.
