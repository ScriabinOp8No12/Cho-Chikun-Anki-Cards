Pattern 14
White to p lay, Black d ies
In this shape,  if it's White  s turn, Black is
easily killed;  if it's Black's turn,  he easily
lives. Even  havi ng said that, however, there
is still room  tor error. First,  think about  how
White, if it's his turn, can kill Black.
Solution 1. The  hane  kills
White's hane at 1 is good  enough.  Black 2 is
the vital point  for making  eye shape, but one
more  vital  point remains  at White 3. Next,
whe n Black blocks at 4, W hite crawls in to 5.
If Black  blocks with 2 at 5, then White makes
a placement of at 3.
Solution 2. The  placem ent
Even if Whit e immediately jumps  in to con-
trol the vital point at White 1, Black dies. Whe n
Black  descends  to 2, Whit e crawls at 3. After
this,  even  if Black  descends  to 'a', White can
play  elsew here  and Black  is still dead.
It seems  as if there might  be still other  play s
which will kill Black, but...
Failure 1. Ko
Althoug h we've  said that Black  is dead virtu-
ally regardless  of how  White plays,  White
should n't be too cavalier about  it For example,
if he begi ns at 1, Black  2 makes eye shape, and
Whit e 3, Black 4 yield  a ko, which is a failure.
For Black,  too, the play at 2 is important...
