Pattern 19
Black is dead
A certain measure of eye space  makes a
group  secure, but, with all of its liberti es
filled in, the cutting point at the 2-2 point
becomes  a weakness. In this shape,  Black
cannot  live even if he gets to make the first
move .
Variation 1. Connecting
Let's take a look at Black's  attempts to live.
First,  the conn ection at Black 1. In this
case, White s hanes at 2 and 4, and the
placeme nt at 6 kill Black  cleanly.
Variation 2. Eye shape
Next, wha t if Black  defends at the 2-1
point?
White is naturally left with the vital  point
at 2 Whe n Black connects at 3, White hanes
at 4. Instead  of 3 —
Variation 3. Fallin g short
Even if Black makes one eye with 3 here,
he is dead  when White cuts at 4. White can
also use 4 to con nect underneath  at 'a' .
Since this is a symmetrical shape,  Black 1
at 2, making  eye shape on the other side,
gives the same r esult
