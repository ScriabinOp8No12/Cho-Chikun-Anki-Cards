Reference 2. Black  has an eye. 
Consi der the throw- in at White 1. In answer
to this, Black 2 is a skillful play which might be
easy  to miss. Next, if White makes  the place-
ment  at 3, Black conne cts at 4. Afte r this a
Whit e play at 'a achieves noth ing and the role
of the black hane  becomes  appa rent.
Reference 3. Seki
This  variatio n also applies  to the origi nal pat-
tern.  In response to White's play  inside at 1,
Black  can simply expand  his eye s pace with 2. If
Whit e 3, Black  connects at 4. Afte r this, even if
Whit e play s 'a', Black is alive in seki.

Diagram 1
Whe n you are invo lved in life-and- death
problems,  the three types of soluti ons you
are concer ned with  are, 'life,' 'death,' and
'ko. ' Rather  than hand ling seki separ ately,
you  should  think of it as one of the
possibi lities under  'life.'
Diagram 2
If someone laid out a prob lem such as that
in diagram 1 as a tesuj i problem,  not simply
a question of life or death,  and asked, 'If it's
Whit e's move,  what type of result  is possi-
ble?', the answer  might be 'seki'. 
Diagram 2 is the solution. Whit e 3 is a
strong  move; the result is seki.
