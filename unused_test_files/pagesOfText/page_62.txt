Failure 2. Also  ko
How about  the descent  to Black  1 here?
This  mov e also creates  a shape  with bad
aji, and after White  attaches at 2, there  is
no way  for Black to live uncondit ionally. If
Black  plays  3, Whit e makes the diagonal
play  at 4; Black is left with no choice but to
throw  in with 5, giving a ko. I f White plays
2 at 4, Black  5, White 2, Black 3 gives the
same ko.
Reference 1. Whi te to play, Black dies
Now  consider where  White , if it's his
turn,  should  play  to kil l Blac k
Actu ally, this is easy. If White plays a
hane  at 1, this becomes  almost the same
shape  as Pattern 3 of this secti on; no mat-
ter what  Black plays,  he cannot live.
Reference 2. Att aching also kills
In addition  to the hane,  there  are other
moves  which kill the blac k group.
To begin with,  Whit e has the attachme nt
at 1. Black  2 is a confus ing play,  but White
coolly descends  to 3, then  plays  5 and 7,
and Black is dead. Instead of 3, if White
rushes  to play  4 and link underneat h, then
Black  throws in 3 at and  gets a ko.
Reference 3. Ko
The placemen t of White 1 also looks  like
a vital point  at first, but Black  will resist
with  2. Black answers White 3 with 4, get-
ting a ko.
