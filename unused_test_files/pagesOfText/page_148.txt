In response to White 1, the connection at
Black 2 is an unexpected ly effective defense.
If it's not handled properly,  White may end
up letting Black live. How should  White
continue his attack?  For instance, if White
plays a hane  at 'a', Black answers at b' and is
alive.
Solution 3. A good play
In this position as well, the descent to
White 1 is a good play  When Black  answers
at 2, White plays  a hane at 3 and once  again
it's a ko.
The ko resulting from White's hane at 3 is
also probably very  easy  to miss  in actual
play.
Variation 2. Rever sion
This is a variatio n of the last diagram If
Black captur es at 2, White  attac hes at 3. You
prob ably saw immediatel y that this reve rts
to Variatio n 1.
Failure. It looks dead,  but.. .
Returning to the begin ning, if White  at-
taches out of the blue  at 1, Black conne cts at
2, then  answers  Whit e 3 by capturin g at 4:
he has been  allowed  to make two eyes. Even
if White now  blocks at 'a', Black conn ects at
3 and has two eyes.
