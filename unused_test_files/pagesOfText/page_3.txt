Preface
These two volumes are a collection, in dictionary format, of shapes
from the basic  to the practical, in which the issue is the life or death of
the groups  involved.  Whi le it is presented  in a proble m format, you
shouldn't feel compell ed to use it like you would  a book  on tsume-go
(life-and-death  problems ), wrestling with every problem  from  begi n-
ning to end.  On the contrary,  this book  is bette r suited to skipping
lightly from  place to place as the mood  strikes  you or as your  needs re-
quire. For example,  both  leafing through  the book,  stopping  to careful-
ly study  only those  shapes  which interes t you,  or going directl y to the
solution diagram  without working through the problem,  are excell ent
ways to use this book  In fact, my fondest wish would  be for you to
keep the book  on your  bedside  table and fall asleep while looking  over
a page or two.  The objective of this book  is to have  you gradually, yet
pain lessly acqu ire an appreciation for a basic appr oach to the problem
of life and death  in go.
In anyth ing, the fundamentals are important; if you n eglect the them
your  performan ce will surely  suffer. For example,  the very first pattern
in this text utilizes the three- space  nakade (large  eye inside a group)
shape. Since  all life and death  problems  in go boil dow n to a quest ion
of one eye or two, this shape  must  be considered the most  basic. If you
are able to learn  to think about  problems  of your  own as a quest ion of
'How can I reduce this to the three-in-a-row shape?'  and then compare
this to the time  when you didn't  think about  a prob lem in that way,
you'l l be able to see that you've  made sign ificant prog ress.
