Failure 1 . A way to die
White's most  effective play is probably
White 1 here.  It seems  as if Black  has no
choice but to respond  by block ing at 2, but
in this position, White will make  the large-
knig ht move at 3, so Black dies.
That means that, Black  has to find a
better  play  for Black 2.
Variation 4. A splendid answe r
After White 1, Black 2 is splendid. The
fact is, this basic shape  has show n up in life
and death problems  since long  ago.
After this, we'll take a more detailed  look
at how  Black goes about making life.

Variation 5. The 2-1 pain t
After the prev ious diagram,  if White con-
tinues by cutti ng at 1, Black  forces at 2 and
then  steps  down  to 4. It's a cramped area,
but Black  is able to play  at both  of the vital
2-1 points  and jus t manages  to live.
Variation 6. Safe
The variation in which White crawls at 1
is quite something. Black has to connect at
2, so White continues with 3 and  5,
planning to make a five-spac e big eye.
However, throwing in at Black  6 becomes  a
good  move for avoid ing the big eye. Black
has managed  to get throug h to safety.
