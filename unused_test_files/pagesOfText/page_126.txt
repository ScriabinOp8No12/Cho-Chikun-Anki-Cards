Pattern 22
Black to play and live
The proble m for Black  is whether  to se-
cure additional eye spac e or give  priority  to
making  eye shape. The fact that Black  has
an liberty  at 'a' is the key to this position.
You need to read it  out thorough ly.
Solution 1. The jump
Black 1 is the point that makes  build ing
eye shape  the easiest  White has no choice
but to make  the placeme nt at 2. After  Black
3, White should  probab ly hane  at 4, but re-
sponding to this by blocking at Black  5 is a
strong move. White 6 is met by Black  7,
forcing White to capture  one stone,  and
Black 9 prepares to recapture at 5.
Solution 2. Losing paints
The conn ection at 1 comes  easily to
mind.  After Whit e 2 to 4, Black 5 is a good
move  which has already  been  show n to
make  the black group  live (page 82). Even
so, since White can get a sente seki,
evaluated from  the point  of view of actua l
play, this  is inferior to Diagram  1.
Reference. Shor tage of liberties
For referen ce, in this shape Black's
liberty  has been filled in by the marked
white stone. This time if Black  plays  the
jump to 1, after the moves  from White 2 to
Black 5, White can play  6 and 8, so Black
dies.
Conse quently, Black must conn ect with
1 at 6; when White attaches  at 'a', the result
is a ten thousand  year ko.
