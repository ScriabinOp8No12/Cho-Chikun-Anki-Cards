Pattern 1
White to p lay and make a ko
If you simply  begin with a hane in the
corner, Black will be able to live.  You
should verify for yourself,  however, that
due to the peculi arities of the corner,  there
are a number of ways to proceed.
Solution 1. Att aching
The vital point  is the attachme nt at White 1.
After Black 2, the jump  to White 3 is also a vital
point  Black  has no choice but to run into White
at 4, so with White  5 and the throw-in at 7, it
becomes  a ko. It is also  possible to play  5
directl y at 7, but in terms of an actual game, 5 is
more profita ble for White.
Solution 2. The  cut
After White 1 and Black  2, White can also cut
at 3, because  the shor tage of libert ies of Black's
three  stones make  it possible to follow Black  4
with  White 5. Whe n Black  captures,  it's a ko.
This  result is the same  as playi ng a ko with 3 at
5, Black  4, White 3.
Solution 3. Playi ng ko directly
In response  to the clam p at Whit e 1, if Black
blocks at 2, White play s an atari at 3. As it
stands  it's a ko fig ht in the corner.
White 3 at 'b', followed by Black 'c', is also a
ko. Instead  of Black 2, connecting tightl y at 'a'
lets Whit e conne ct underneath  at 3 and Black
dies.
