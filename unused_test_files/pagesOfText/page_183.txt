Pattern 32
Black to play and live
The black posit ion has been reinfo rced
with a connection at the marked  black
stone. There is more than one way  to live.
However, there  are also variat ions in which
a shortage of libert ies can result in sudd en
death,  so you  need  to be  careful.
Solution 2. No  chinks
The open conn ection of Black 1 gives  an
unarguabl y living shape.  If Whit e continues
with  'a , Black can simply  block at 'b'. Also, in
response  to White 'c', Black 'd' makes  certain of
two eyes, f d like you to confirm for yourself
that descending to 'a' instead  also makes Black
alive.
Solution 2. De scent
One  more  way  of living is the descent  of
Black  1. In response  to White 2, the diagonal
attachment  at 3 is good  and even  if White cuts
at 4, Black  can conn ect at 5.
Even if Whit e plays 2 at 3, Black again  makes
a diag onal attachment, this time at 2, and is
alive.
Failure. Short age of liberties
What about  the desce nt to Black  1 here?
Whit e makes the placement at 2 and this time
there  is troubl e. In answer to Black 3, Whit e
cuts with  4 and after Black  secures an eye at 5,
blocks at 6. Black's  shortage  of liberties proves
fatal.
Addit ionally, when  Black  makes  the open
connection with 1 at 3, White cuts  at 4 and
Black  is dead .
