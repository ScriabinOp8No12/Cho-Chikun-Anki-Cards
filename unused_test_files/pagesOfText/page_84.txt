Failure 2. Ko
Whit e's block at 1 is an ordinary move .
Black plays  the open  connection at 2 and af-
ter White 3 and Black  4, a ko results.
In actual play, this is prob ably the result
more times than not.
Failure 3. Descent
Whit e's descent  to 1 is a calm play , but it
isn't success ful. Black  2 is the vital point.  Af-
ter this, White can't do anything more than
make the ordinary attacking plays  of 3 and
5; up to 6, Black is alive.
If instead  of 2, Black blocks at 3, White
makes the placement at 2 and Black dies.
Reference 1. A requi rement for Whit e
In this pattern , attentio n must also be
paid to the forma tion of whit e stones which
surround the black group.  To a certain
extent, the perimeter must be secure.
For example,  if there  were  no whit e stone
at 'a', then  the procedure  of White 1 and 3
woul d not necessari ly be perfect  Consider
the next diagram...
Reference 2. Bad aji
There is now  room  for a black response at
1 and 3. The moves  from Whit e 4 to 8 do
produce, at least partial ly, a dead shape for
Black, but Black's block at 7 makes  the
clamp at 9 possib le. The cont inuation White
'a', Black 'b' will quite likely prove
troublesome.
