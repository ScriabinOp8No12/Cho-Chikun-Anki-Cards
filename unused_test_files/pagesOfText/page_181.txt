Pattern 30
Black is dead
This is a smaller  version of the com b pat-
tern, with a base.  The fact that all of the out-
side liberties of this shape  have  been  filled
in is a major shortcom ing. No matter how
Black plays, he  cannot live. Lets first  investi-
gate this claim.
Variation 1. O pen connectio n
Black 1 appears  to be the likely vital  point of
this position. Howev er, White first inserts a cut
at 2 and when  Black answers at 3, follo ws up
with  hane at 4 and  Black is dead.
For Whit e, too, the cut at 2 is important If he
simply  plays a hane at 4, Black  will play  at 2,
making  an eye and mana ging to survive.
Variation 2. The  same resu lt
Next  lets try making an open  connection on
the right side at Black 1. The logic is the same.
Whit e cuts with 2, then  plays  a hane at 4 and
Black  is dead .
Variation 3. D escent
Fina lly, let's try descend ing to 1, expan ding
the black base.  In this case,  White  plays  hane at
2. In answer  to Black 3, Whit e 4 and 6 are good
enough.  Instead  of 2, cutting  immediately at 4,
Black  5, and White  6 also kills the group.
If Black  plays  1 at 2, then White 1, Black  6
and White 5 follow.
