Variation 4. D escen t #1
How about  descending at 1 to expan d
Black's  eye space? This, too, is not a difficult
shape.  If White  hanes  at 2, Black's block at 3
makes  this into the five-space big eye. The
placeme nt at W hite 4 kills the group.
For Whit e 2 and 4, other moves  are pos-
sible, but inve stigation is probabl y pointless.
Variation 5. D escen t #2
To conti nue, next  is Black's descent at 1.
Here  too White  should hane  at 2. Whe n
Black  blocks  at 3, we once again have  the
easy- to-kill five-space big eye.
Reference 1. Ha ne makes no difference
Suppose  that Black has the benefit of
hanes  at both  Black 1 and 3. If it's his turn,
doesn't  he have room to li ve now?
The answer  is 'no',  so Whit e should  re-
spond  calml y with  2 and 4.
Reference 2. Sa me result
After the last diagram,  lets look  at Black's
jump  to 1. just as befor e, Whit e 2 is the vital
point.  After Black 3, White  throws in at 4,
and there is no way for Black  to live.
The turn  of Black  1 at 'a' is also killed  by
Whit e 'b', just as before. You should investi-
gate Black's  other possible moves your self.
