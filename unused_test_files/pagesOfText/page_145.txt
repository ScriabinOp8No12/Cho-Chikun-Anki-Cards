Pattern 4
White to p lay and make a ko
A hane  has been added  to the black  posi-
tion, so it looks  as if Black  is alive, but even
with the hane, Black hasn't  corrected  all of
his defects.  There is still room  for Whit e to
play first and force a ko.
Solution 1. Ata ri from the left side
Once  again,  White's only  move  is the
attachment  at 1. After  Black 2 there  is no room
for White to play at 'a , but the atari at 3 is still
threatening. Black is forced to defe nd with 4, so
Whit e captures  with 5, sta rting a ko.
Variation. Shortage of Iiberties
After White 1 and the atari at 3, should Black
connect at 4, White has the cut at 5. because of
his shortage  of liberties, Black cannot play atari
at 'a'.
Having said that, if Black  has even a single
liberty  on the outs ide, not even a white
attachment  at 1 will work against the black
group.
Solution 2. The  throw-in
After White 1, it looks  as if Black  is safe if he
connects at 2, but White throws  in at 3 and gets
a ko. Because  the corner  is such  a confined area,
it's surprisin gly easy to misread  this  ko.
