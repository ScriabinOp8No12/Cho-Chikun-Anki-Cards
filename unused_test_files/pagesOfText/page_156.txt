Failure 1. Ko
Returnin g to the begin ning, the
attachment at 1 is a sharp  play,  but it's a little
bit too tricky  Whe n Black  blocks at 2, White
has the neat  play of atari at 3, but Black
defends  at 4 and White  miss es his chance to
kill Black  outright
Failure 2. Atari undern eath
What  about the atari underneat h at White
1? The jump  to Black 2 turn s out to be the
correct  defense  after all. This  positio n,
however, does  require some caution  after
Whit e attaches at 3. If Black connects at 'a',
Whit e's cut at 'b' will mean  sudden death for
Black because  of the shortage  of libertie s of
the two black stones in the corner.
Failure 3. White's shortage of liberties
Conti nuing from the previous  diagram,
Black has to block at 1. After White 2, Blac k 3
and 5 fill in the white libert ies and Black can
aim to trap two of the Whit e stones. Note
that Black has a liberty at 'a'. If this were
filled in, Blac k would n't be able to press a t 5.
Failure 4. As requ ested
After White's atari  at 1, conn ecting at 2 is
exactly what White wants  Black to do. White
makes the placeme nt at 3 and answe rs Black
4 by cutting  at 5; Black becom es unab le to
press down because  of his shortage of
liberties.
