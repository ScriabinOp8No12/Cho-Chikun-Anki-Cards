Pattern 2
White to p lay, Black d ies
White has play ed at the corner  of this 'six-
space eye' group.  What  difference does  this
make?  Also, pay attention to the status of
the outside  liberties.
Solution. Belly attachment
White 1 again turns  out to be success ful.
Black has to conne ct at 2, and White's
descent to 3 produces  a dead s hape.
Atta ching at 3 instead  of Black  2 makes
no difference. White cuts  at 2 and it's all
over.
Failure 1. Ko
The placemen t at White 1 is also at a vital
point When  Black  attaches  with 2, White's
block at 3 produce s a ko.
If Black uses 4 to connect at 'a', a white
play at 4 kil ls him.
Failure 2. Starting the ko
This is a variation of the last diagram.  If
White decides to throw in at 3 instead of
blocking on the outside,  it becomes  Blacks
turn  to take the ko first rather than  White's.
This  is a loss for White.
In either case, making  a ko in this
situation is a failure for White.
