Pattern 11
Black is alive
Legs  have  been  added to the base on both
sides of the original L-shape. This shape  is
alive, even if White plays  first This is an im-
portant  area of fundame ntal knowho w, so
let's investi gate it briefl y.
Variation 1. Corr ect response
Lets take a look  at a num ber of possibl e
avenues  for Whit e on his turn.  First is the
hane at 1. In response,  the jump to Black 2 is
correct After this, the vital  point  has to be at
'a', b ut this is easi ly answered by Black 'b'.
Variation 2. Alive,  but...
In response  to White s hane at 1, Black
can also live by turni ng at 2 However,
Whit e has the placeme nt at 3, so it's a little
complicated.  At White 5, Black desc ends to
6. Up to White 7 is a seki.  Of course,  if Black
is alive  in both  cases, then  having territory ,
as in the previous  diag ram, is better.
Variation 3. Hane on the opposite side
Wha t about if White plays  a hane on the
opposi te side? In this case, Black's turn at 2
is a straight  forward way  to live. The only
remaining vital point  is the placement at 3,
but Black  blocks at 4 and has no probl ems.
