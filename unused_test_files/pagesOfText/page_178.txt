Pattern 28
White to p lay, Black d ies
Beca use Black  has an extra  liberty at 'a',
you can't proceed  as in the previous  pattern.
However, as before,  if it's White's turn  to
play, Black  dies.  What  kind  of proc edure
does  White have available to him?  The first
move  is the k ey.
Solution 1. Ju mp
The jump down to the first line is a
good  move  here.  Afte r Black 2 to 4, White
attaches  at 5. If White 1 were  at 'a', then
White 5 woul dn't work.
Note  that the jump  to White 1 would
have  worked in the previ ous pattern  as
well, but we weren't  ready  to discuss  it
yet.
Solution 2. R esistance
After White 1, Black 2 is a strong
answe r, so White  has to be cunni ng as
well. The attachment at White 3 prev ents
further resistance, since after  Black  4,
White 5 to 9 kill the black  group.  In the
middle  of this sequence, should Black
play 4 at 'a', White answers at 'b', Black 'c',
and then  White  5 gives  the same result
Failure. Tricked
After White 1 and Black 2, if White
plays 3, he has been caught in Black's trap.
With 4 and 6, Black is able to make eye
shape and  with Black  8 he g ets a ko. Wh ite
can yield the ko by connecting at 'a', then
start the ko fight  again after  Black 'b'.
