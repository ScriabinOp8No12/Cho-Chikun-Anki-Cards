Failure 1. Black is hast y
What about  White's  throw- in at 1? If
this killed Black,  things would be simple
for White.
Black 2 is hasty, as the white hane  at 3
kills him.
Failure 2. A good  move
After White 1, dodging  to Black 2 is a
good  move.  In answer  to White's place-
ment  at 3, Black connects at 4, and White
'a' doesn't  work  In this situation, the
mark ed black stone is making its prese nce
felt
The point  of this diagra m is to show
that Whit e's throw-in at 1 does n't work.
Failure 3. The hane  is working
What about White's attachment at 1?
Black 2 is tenac ious,  and after White 3,
Black descend s to 4. The shape resulti ng
from the sequence up to Black  6 is alive.
Next, if  White  plays 'a', Black  'b'.
Halfway through , if White plays  5 at 6,
then  Black 5. The marked  black  stone  is
definitely making  its pres ence felt.
Failure 4. Ko
After White 1 and Black  2, White's best
play is at 3, but after Black 4, and 6 White
still can't do bette r than an approach-
move  ko. Black  can even play elsewhere,
if he wishes, after  a white play  at 'a'.
By the way, if in the basic  pattern  the
hane  of the marked  black stone  is changed
to a hane at 'a', then a white hane  at 'b'
easily kills the group.
