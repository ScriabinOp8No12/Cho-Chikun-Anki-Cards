Failure 2. Ko
After White 1 to Black  4, play ing the
hane  and conne ction of White 5 and 7 is
careless. Black 8 is at the vital  point  and a
ko rema ins. White  'a', Black 'b' and Whit e
'c' produce  a direct ko.
Solution 3. D iagonal attachment
After White 1 and 3, Black descend s to 4,
trying  to expand  his eye space. In this posi-
tion, the diag onal attachme nt of White 5 is
the vital point After  this,  if Black  'a', White
occup ies Black's weak  point  at `b', creatin g
a big eye. If Black plays 4 at 'b', Whit e 'a' is
good e nough.
Failure 3. Simply making the place ment
If White simply  begi ns with the
placeme nt at 1, Black will descend to 2,
creating a somewha t troublesome  shape.
White 3 is still the vital point,  but Black 4
and  6 provide considerable  resistan ce.
After this, White 'a', Black  'b' and White 'c'
make  this a one-step ko for Black,  but any
ko is a failure for White. 
Failure 4. Black's lack of imagination
After White 1 to 3, trying to make an eye
at 4 is bad, as White 5 and 7 kill the black
group.  This  turns White 's direct  placement
into a successful move . Of course,  this is
only  because  Black's technique  was
inadequate  to th e task
