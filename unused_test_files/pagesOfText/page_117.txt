Pattern 15
White to p lay, Black d ies
White's attack  is the same  as in several  of
the previous  patterns.
However, I'd also like to examine  the ef-
fect of changes  in White' s encircling forma-
tion on this  position .
Solution 1. Ha ne and place ment
Here,  too, the hane followed by a placement
is the correct technique. After Black 4, Whit e's
descent  at 5 is also a play that you'v e learn ed
previous ly. When Black plays 6, White has the
throw- in at 7, which ruins Black's eye on the
left
Even if Black  plays  4 at 'a, White's descent at
5 is good enough.
Solution 2. Sa me thing
Even if Black tries the thrust  at 4, he has no
answer  to White 's descent at 5. If he conti nues
with  Black  'a', Whit e answers at 'b'; if instead he
perseveres  with  'c', White can atari  at 'd'.
Solution 3. Un related
After White 1 to 3, what  if Black first tries  to
extricate  himse lf by capturing  at 4? White
simply  defend s at 5 and Black's  captur e at 4 is
not going to be of any assistan ce in living. You
should  understan d this aspect of this shape
thorough ly.
