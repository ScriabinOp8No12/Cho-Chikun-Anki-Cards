Pattern 19
White to p lay, Black d ies
If White plays normally, this will becom e
a ko. If he attacks  poorly,  Black will live.
However, if he attacks  cleverly Black  is un-
conditionally dead. The secret is a combi na-
tion play w ith the first  and third moves.
Solution 1. Ju mp to the first line
First  is the peep at White 1, then whe n Black
connects at 2, jumping down  to the  first  line at 3
is tesuji. When  Black plays  4, White descends  to
5. Notice  that the two stones  in the corner are
connected to Whit e 3. If Black  plays  'a , White
answers  at 'b', then if Black 'c', defending at
Whit e 'd' is good enough.
Solution 2. Black  tries to expand  his base.
After White 1 and 3, what  it Black  tries  to
expand  his eye spac e with 4 and 6? In response,
Whit e's descent  to 7 is easy to understand. If
Black  contin ues at 'a', White 'b', Black  'c', and
Whit e 'd' foll ow.
Instead  of 7, White  could  also either play  a
hane  at 'b' or descend to 'd'.
Failure 1. Whi te cannot connect  outside
After White 1 and Black  2, why is descendi ng
to 3 no good ? This  question is the point  of this
particu lar pattern.
In response  to Black 4, White descends  to 5,
but Black blocks at 6 and White's two stones
cannot connect to the outside. Because  of this,
Black  ends up aliv e.
