Pattern 1
White to p lay, Black d ies
This is the six-space group.  Notic e that all
of the outs ide libertie s are filled in. If it's
White's turn, Black will die; however,  it's
easy to sl ip up if  you're not careful .
Solution. Shortage of liberties
The attachment at Whit e 1 is correct
Black is forced to make a counter-attach-
ment  at 2, but blocking at White 3 is good
enough.  Because of his shortage of liberties,
Black cannot  block at 'a' , so he dies. This
shortage  of libert ies might  be something of
a blind spot for you.
Failure. Ko
White 1 is also at a vital point and forces
Black 2. Now, after  Whit e 3, Black plays at 4
to get a ko.
If Black  doesn't use 4 to make ko, then
White can play there and make the shape
into a bent  four  in the corner. In any case,
ko is a failure for White.
Reference 1. Black  is alive
One of Black's  outside  liberties is open.
Now  what  happens if it's White's turn  to
play?
In response  to the attachment of White  1,
Black again  plays  2. Now,  howe ver, when
White play s 3, Black  can fill in at 4 and is
unconditionally alive. Accord ingly, in this
case Whit e 1 is a mis take.
