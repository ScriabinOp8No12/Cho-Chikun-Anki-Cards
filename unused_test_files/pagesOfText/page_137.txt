Pattern 30
B1ack is alive
The base  of Black's position  is ope n, heav-
ing some  bad aji, but his hangi ng connec-
tion on the left side gives him good  shape,
so as it stands,  he is alive. However, in actu-
al play, discovering the correct  way  to live
when White attacks  is not easy.
Variation 1. Straightforward
Whit e's first  attacki ng play  is sliding in
with  the large- knight move at 1. However,
pulli ng back at 3 next  woul d just let Black
live easily by making  an eye at 4 .
Even  if it doesn't  work, White must  come
up with  som ething better than 3.
Variation 2. Forcing Whit e to cut
After White 1 and Black 2, Whit e has to
make  the placement at 3 to have  any
chance. If Black  answers by connecting at 5,
Whit e pulls back at 4 and  Black  dies.
Conse quently, Black  has no choice but to
block at 4; after White 5, making an eye
with  Black 6 and  8 allows  him to liv e.
Variation 3. R ejecting ko
After White 1 and Black 2, Whit e 3 is
quite an aggressive answer. In answer to
Black  4, White gets ready to play  a ko with
5, but by descending to 6, Black can refuse
to fight a ko. This  is beca use, after the
cont inuation of White 'a', Black  'b', and
Whit e 'c', Black  can squeeze in at 'd'.
