Pattern 13
Black to play and live
As we move from  the basic patterns to
the practi cal applications, the shapes  will
change  little by little.
This black group  is a somewhat unsatis-
factory shape, but if it's Black's turn , he can
live. The  hane on the  left side is his lifeline.
Solution 1. Di agonal play
Black's diagon al move  at 1 is a good play.
Whit e's push  at 2 and placement at 4 are at the
vital points,  but securin g an eye with  Black 5 is
good enough.
The open  liberty at 'a' is also coming  to his
rescue.  If this liberty were filled in, then the cut
at 'b'  would  kill Black
Solution 2. Turning  the tables
After Black 1, you might  also  think of the
placeme nt at White 2 Black  3 is force d and with
Whit e 4 and 6, you might, for an insta nt, think
it is ko. However, it is not ko; Black fills in with
7 and 9 and turns the table s on White, catch ing
two white stones  through a shortage  of liber-
ties.
Of course, in actual play you would  capture
once  with 7 at 'a'.
Solution 3. The  2-1 poi nt
After Black  1, if White hanes  at 2, Black  is
solidl y alive  with 3. Black 1 and 3 are both  at
the 2-1 vital  points. As a rule, if you play  at two
vital points,  you wil l be aliv e.
