Failure 1. Approach -move ko
White's attachment at 1 is also a possibility,
but it is not the best way  Afte r Black 2 and
Whit e 3, Black  starts  the ko fight with 4. Unfor-
tunately,  in this positio n, after winning the ko
Whit e will still have  to craw l at 'a' in order to
start  a real ko for the life of the group.  In other
words,  it's an appr oach-move  ko. 
Failure 2. Vulgar
The worst  possible play is pushi ng with  !.
Needless  to say, Black  lives easily  with 2. 
Play ing this way totally  wastes  the value  of
the marked whit e stone.
 
Bent Four in the Corner (1)
Why has the position  Bent Four  in the Corner'
been declared,  by rule,  to be unconditionally
dead?
Diagram 1: In this positio n, if neither Black nor
Whit e makes a move,  it will be a seki; however,
there is room  for White , begi nning with  Whit e
1, to attempt  to capture  the black group.  The
result of that attempt  is seen in Diagram  2. 
Diagram 2: As shown, the attempt  ends  in a ko,
but the fact that White can wait to take these
steps at a time of his own  choosi ng is an im-
portant point  Before begi nning the ko, White
can eliminate all of Black's poss ible ko threats,
making it certain that White will win the ko.
This is why such  a group is ruled dead. (See  page 19. )
