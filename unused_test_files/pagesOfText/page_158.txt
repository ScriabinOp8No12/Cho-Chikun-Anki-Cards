Variation 2. Nowh ere to press
To continue, White has the placement at
4. When Black  mak es an eye with 5, Whit e
cuts  at 6. Black can't  press down  on the
white stones because of his shortage of
libert ies. The marked  white stone  is making
its presence  felt
In other  words,  Black has no choice but to
play the ko after all.
Variation 3. False  eye
After White 1 to 3, what about  play  Black
4 in the corner  to make one  eye?  In
response, White's answer at 5 and 7 is ironic.
Black ends up with a false eye and  the
mark ed white stone  does its work  after  all.
Variation 4. Diagonal attachment
Going back  to the begin ning, lets try an-
swering White's placement by making the
open connection at 2. Naturally, Whit e cuts
at 3. Black has no choice but to connect at 4,
and White  pushes at 5, so Black  again  is
unabl e to press down on Whi te because  of
his shortage  of liberties.
Variation 5. Connection
In the same manner, let's look  at Black's
answering White 1 with the bump  at 2 This
time extendin g to 3 is good enough.  After
Black 4, Whi te turns at 5 and because  of
Black's shortage of liberties, White conne cts
his two stones to the outsi de. Even  if Black
plays 4 at 'a', White  plays at 5 and gets the
same r esult
