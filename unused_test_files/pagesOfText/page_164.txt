Pattern 18
White to p lay and make a ko
It looks  as if Black  is alive, but his short-
age of libert ies give s White  a chance. Whit e
has two options  for his first move, but the
technique is exactly  the sam e.
Solution 1. Placement
Whit e's placemen t at 1 is the vital point
Black has no choice but to connect at 2, so
White tries to conne ct underneath with 3.
Black again has no option  but to throw in at
4 to m ake a ko.
If Black  play s 2 at 4, Whit e cuts at 2 and
Black can't play  at 'a' beca use of his
shortage of libert ies.
Solution 2. Hane
If White starts with the hane  at 1, he ends
up with  the same ko. Whe n Black  blocks at
2, White plays  atari at 3, and Black  has no
choice but to defend at 4 after  all.
In addition  to Whit e 3, the atari  at 'a'
looks as if it migh t be effective, but Black
would capture  at b' and White can do
noth ing.
Reference.  An open liberty
Because Black  has an extra liberty at 'a ,
the story is differe nt In answe r to Whit e 1,
Black's diagonal attachment at 2 is good; af-
ter White 3, Black  can block on this side
with 4.
In other words,  this  shape  is
unconditionally alive.
