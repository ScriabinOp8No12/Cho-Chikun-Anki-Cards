Failure 3. An ir onic play
In the begin ning, White 1, blocking on the
outside  and filling Black's liberty , is an ironic
play.  After  playing this, White cannot  kill
Black.
Black's defense at 2 is dubious, as White at-
taches  at 3, and with Black 4, White  5 it be-
comes  a ko.
Failure 4. Best  defense
In response to White 1, defendi ng at 2 is a
good  move. In this case, if White plays at 'a',
Black  answers at 'b', and  noth ing happens.
You could  say that White's blocking play  at
1 turns  out to be  a fraud.

Next,  what  if Black  is give n an extra liberty
at 'a'? In that case, the possibl e results  from a
whit e play  here  also  change.
First  there  is the belly attachment at Whit e
1, but after Black attaches  at 2, he is alive. In
the cont inuation, 'b' and 'c' are miai.

How about  the placeme nt at Whit e 1?
Whe n Black plays 2, White  s block at 3 is a
good move.  Next, Black  4, White 5 starts a ko.
Be careful  of playing  White  3 at 'a'. Black
will set up a squeeze  with Black 4, Whit e 5,
Black  'b', an d live.
