Pattern 7
Black to live
In the corner,  replacing the extension to
the edge  of the board  with a hane weakens
Black's shape.  If it's Black's turn  and he
wants to live, where  is the vital point ?
Solution. Part ition
Black 1, establishing a partitio n between  the
two eyes, is clever  The presence  of the hane
means  that if White play s 2, Black's capture  at 3
gives  him one eye at 'a', and he is assured  of a
second  eye by simply  blocking a white hane at
'b' with 'c'. 
Failure 1. As  wide  as poss ible?
Expa nding your eye space  is not always  the
answer.  It looks  as if Black is alive after  he de-
scends  to 1, but after Whit e attacks with 2 and
4, Black  is left with  only one eye. The throw- in
of White 2, in particul ar, is essentia l.
Failure 2. Reve rsion
What happens whe n Black,  still trying  to ex-
pand  his eye spac e, connects at 1? In that case
we return to the same  shape as in the previous
pattern.  After the com bination of White 2 and 4,
Black  is dead .
