Pattern 12
White to p lay and make a ko
In this position it seems as if Black's  base
is suffi ciently wide, but his lack of outside
libert ies and the presence of the marked
white stone give White an opportunity.
Solution. Attach  at the vital point
The attachment at White 1 is a good  move.
Whe n Black  blocks at 2, crawl ing to 3 is an im-
portant  play. Black has no choice but to throw
in with 4, and  now  White  5 starts a ko fig ht.
Being in a hurry and starting  the ko with
Whit e 3 at 5 yields only  a one- step appro ach
move  ko for White,  so be careful . It would also
let Black captur e the ko first
Reference. Bent  four in the corner
If Black  fails to start the ko with Blac k 4 in the
previous  diagra m, White  stretches out with 1.
This  is not seki,  it is a bent  four  in the corner,
and is unc onditionally dead. 
Variation. Unconditional death
In response  to the attachmen t of White  1,
blocking at Black  2 is a defensive mistake.
Whit e hanes at 3, and then  because of a short-
age of  liberties Black  cannot block at 'a'.
