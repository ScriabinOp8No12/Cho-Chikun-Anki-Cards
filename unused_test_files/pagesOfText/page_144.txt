Pattern 3
White to p lay and make a ko
Black's three stones have an extra liberty
on the outside.  In the previous  pattern  there
were several  methods  of obtai ning a ko, but
in this pattern they have been reduced  to
only  one.
Solution 2. The  same idea
As you might  have thought,  for his first
move,  Whit e is left with only the attachme nt at
1. When  Black descends  to 2, White jumps  to 3.
This,  again, is his only  option.  The idea  behi nd
Black  4 to 8 appeared in Pattern  1. Note  that,
whe n Whit e wins the ko, he connects at 8 and
Black  is dead .
Failure. The cut doe sn't work
After White 1 and Black  2, cutti ng with 3 is
unsuc cessful. Once Black  plays atari  with 4, it's
all over.  Since  he has an extra liberty even if
Whit e plays a hane at 'a', Black  can simply
block at 'b'.
Solution 2. Im mediate ko
In response  to White 1, Black also  has the
choice of blocking with 2. Whit e 3 and Black  4
then  prod uce a ko .
If White plays 1 at 3, Black  descend s to 1 and
makes  the comb shape.  Also, White  1 at 'a' lets
Black  play  'b' and live. Refer  to the previous
patterns  for both mov es.
