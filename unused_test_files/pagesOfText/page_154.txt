Failure 2. Atar i on the bottom
Play ing atari on the edge  at White 1 is in the
category  of good  move s. If Black conn ects at 2,
Whit e makes the placeme nt at 3 and answers 4
by cutti ng at 5, so Black  is dead. If Black
cont inues by capturing at 'a', White  'b' is good
enough.
However,  Black's connection at 2 in this
diagram  is a m istake.
Failure 3. Jum p
Answering White 1 by jumping to 2 is a good
move.  As you can see, 'the center  of three
stones'  is the vital point
If Black makes the open connection at 'a'
instead  of 2, White  jumps to 2 and Black  is
dead.
Let's investigate the positi on resulti ng from
Black's  jump to 2 a l ittle further.
Failure 4. Resp onding to the attachment
White 1 is a confusing play,  but Black can
simply  connect at 2. If Black  uses  2 to connect at
'a', Whit e captures  at 2 and  Black  dies.  
Reference. Black  is alive
The quest ion here  is what to do whe n Black
has an extr a liberty as at 'a'.
White tries the placeme nt in 'the center  of
three  stones; but Black makes  an open
connection at 2; in answer  to Whit e's cut at 3, he
can play atari at 4, so there  is no way  to kill
him.
