Pattern 12
White to p lay and get a k o
White's descent  at the marked white
stone must  be given some  close  attentio n. If
it's Whit e's turn , he does  have possibilities
now  But the result  is only a two- step ko, so
Black is not  going to suffer  all that  much.
Solution 1. Att achment
White makes the attac hment at 1 and an-
swers  Black's  hane at 2 with a diag onal play at
3. When  Black plays 4, the hane at 5 and throw-
in at 7 produce  a ko. In the middle  of this se-
quence, at Black 4, there  is an important  varia-
tion,  but th at is for later.
By the  way,  what  kind  of ko is  this?
Solution 2. Two- step ko
White has made a ko threat somewhere,  and
recaptured  at 1. If White  coul d mak e one more
move  and resolve things,  then  this would  be a
direct  ko, but he can't  After White  takes  at 'a',
the ko will be fought all over  again. In other
words,  it's a two- step ko.
Variation. Black dies
After White 1 to 3, if Black decides to play at-
ari at 4, the potential for ko is erased,  but, whe n
Black  play s 6, White hanes at 7 and beca use of
his shorta ge of liberties, Black can no longer
play  in at 'a'. It's when  this positio n develops
that the marked  white stone mak e its presence
felt.
