Pattern 3
White to p lay, Black d ies
If the marked  White stone were not
pres ent Black could  play  elsewhere and still
be alive. However, if it is White's turn , the
issue is how to make the marked  stone
work for him.
Solution 1. Beginn ing inside
White 1 is the critical point  for inter fering
with  Black's mak ing two eyes.  If Black 2, then
with  the attachment at 3, White  can make  the
left side into a false eye. Should  Black descend
at 3, Wh ite plays inside at 2. 
This  is not, however, the only possi bility for
Whit e 1. 
Solution 2. Fro m the outs ide
White can also start by attaching at 1. After
Black  2, White 3 inside kills  the group.  This is
not exactly the same technique as in the previ-
ous diag ram and you need to understand the
differences betwee n them. To that end,  take
heed  of the variation in the next  diagram.  
Solution 3. Da ngerous
Conti nuing from  the previous  diagram,  after
Black  1, White 2 and 4 ruin  Black's  second eye.
Whit e may feel nervous about  having two
stones  captured,  but the follow up throw- in (4)
is a standard  techn ique.
