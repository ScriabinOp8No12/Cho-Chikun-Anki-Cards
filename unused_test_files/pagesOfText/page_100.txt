Failure 2. Ko
After White 1 and Black  2, the
straightforward hane  at 3 is possible. Black
has no choice but to block at 4, so next
Whit e plays atari at 5. Next,  due to a
shor tage of liberties,  Black  can't play the
sequence Black 'a' White 'b', Black  6 and
live, but he c an play 6 to force  a ko.
Failure 3. Placement
If a ko is all Whit e wants, after White 1
and Black  2, it would  be simpler just to
make the placeme nt at 3. Black has to de-
fend at 4 and pushi ng in with  White 5
starts a ko. Next would be Black  'a', White
'b'.
Reference 1. Hane and attachment
Here, the hane at the marked  black stone
has been added  to the original pattern.
Wha t kind of variations does this produce?
After White 1 to 5, Black 6 is a calm an-
swer In this case,  Black  is absolutel y alive.
If Black  captures  a stone  at 'a instead,
Whit e will play  hane  at 'b' and Black is
dead.
Reference 2. Ko
Whe n the hane is present,  the sequen ce
from White 1 to 5, leading to a ko, becomes
the best result  for Whit e.
If Black  plays 4 at 'a', White  still plays  5
and Black  again  play s at 4.
