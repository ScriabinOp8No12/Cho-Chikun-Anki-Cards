Pattern 6
White to p lay, Black d ies
This 'eight- space'  pattern  has a dent in it,
and actuall y consist s of only  seven  spaces.
Black's defect  is, of cour se, the cutting point
at 'a'. The question is how to punish  him for
it, but  don't  settle for  a ko!
Solution. Attach ment
There  is no need  to think up somethi ng
compli cated, as Whit e's attachment at 1
will suffice. Black  must  connect at 2, so
Whit e can follow up with the hane at 3. If
Black  conti nues with  `a', White plays  'b';
this is not seki:  it's a four- space big eye.
Failure 1. Ko
White's place ment at 1 also seems  like a
good  move;  howe ver Black  can resist by
attach ing at 2 and conti nue by answer ing 3
at 4 to force  a ko.
If Black  answers  with 2 at 3, then  White
2, Black  5 also  produce a ko.
A black response  of 2 at 'a' will be
answered  by White  3, which reverts  to the
solutio n diagram, so B lack is dead.
Failure 2. Seki
At first glance, the placeme nt at White 1
also has the appearance  of a tesuji,  but with
the diagona l attachme nt at 2, Black makes
an eye for himsel f and there  is nothing
Whit e can do. White 3 is sente,  but after
this,  the best he can do is fill in the black
liberty  at 'a' and make a gote s eki.
