Pattern 11
Black to play and live
By maximizing his eye space  Black  has
just enough  room  to live, but there  is one
thing that Black must  be careful  about To
begi n with, however, he must determ ine
where to make the  fast play.
Solution 1. Four- in-a-row living shape
The ordinary  descent  to Black  1 is sufficient.
Whit e can t do anything better than  hane at 2,
but then Black  3 produces the problem -free
four- in-a-row living shape.
Solution 2. A te rritorial loss
Descendi ng at Black  1 also makes Black  alive;
howe ver,  it cannot  be considered the best
method  of doing  so. Whe n White plays  2, Black
has no choice but to retreat  with Black 3. Com-
pared  to the previous diagram,  Black  loses  as
much  as 2 points  of territory.  
Do you see why  it is nece ssary to yield  with
Black  3?
Failure 1. Attach ment
After descending at 1, if Black careless ly an-
swers  Whit e's hane at 2 by blocking at 3, he will
be in serious  trouble.  White  will imm ediately
attach  at 4. Now Black will have  to pay a price
in order to l ive.
