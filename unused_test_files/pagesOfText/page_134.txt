Failure 2. Ko
After White 1 to Black  4, you might see
the vital point  at White  5 first However, in
this case,  Black makes eye shape with 6; even
if White attacks  at 7, the best he can get is a
ko.
Solution 3. Desperate
After White 1 and 3, Black 4 is a desperate
measure.  Of course,  White 5 is the vital
point: after Black  6, playin g atari at 7 kills
Black unconditionally.
If White gets flustered and plays  5 at 7, he
lets Blac k play 'a' and live.
Failure 3. The big  jump
Wan ting to enter  just a little bit deeper  is
hum an nature  and the slide to White 1 is
prob ably the first thing that comes  to mind.
In response,  the attachment at 2 is too
straigh tforward.  After White  pulls  back
with 3, there isn't enough  space  for Black  to
make life. Black 2 is equally as bad a move
as W hite 1.
Failure 4. Ko
In response  to White 1, Black has to put
up a fight with 2 and 4. Afte r Whit e 5, Black
plays atari at 6; after  White 'a', a ko fight de-
velops. Needless  to say ko is a failure  for
White.
