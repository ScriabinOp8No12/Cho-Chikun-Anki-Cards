Pattern 24
White to p lay and make a ko
Unlike the previous  pattern, Black has a
liberty  at 'a . Because  of this, he will be hard
for White to deal  with. The final result  is a
ko, but as there  are some  extremely  compl i-
cated variat ions, pay close attention to this
position.
Solution 1. The strongest way  for both sides
 Playing a hane  at 1 followed  by the place-
ment  at 3 is the techn ique for attacking this
black group.  When  Black  connects at 4,
White 5 is a steady response; when Black
plays 6, Whit e 7 and the push in at 9 make a
ko. In the middle of this, if Black plays  2 at 7,
White plays 6.
Reference.  The nature of this ko
Whit e has just pushed  in with the marked
stone. Even  if Black  plays  elsew here  once  it's
still a ko, albeit an approach- move ko for
White, However, when White captures  at 'a',
it now  becom es a one-step  approach-move
ko that favors  White.  Therefore, rather than
being a normal  approach move ko, this is a
direct ko.
Failure 1. A hard customer
After White 1 and Black  2, pushi ng at 3
and then making  the placeme nt at 5 is also a
strong way  to play, but the variations can be
very difficult Black's  best move is to make
contact at 6. The  questi on is what  will
happen next.
