Pattern 27
White to p lay, Black d ies
Simply think about  this shape as if Black
had just played  the stone on the 2-2 point  to
get life. If you stay calm and don't  get flus-
tered, you'll be able to figure  out how to
make this  into  a dead s hape.
Solution. Descent
Descendi ng to 1 is good enough . Black's
open  connection at 2 is the key point for
making eye shape,  but after  White 3 and
Black  4, the diagonal move  at White 5
becomes  a good  move.  In answer to Black 6,
Whit e can turn  in at 7. The shortage of
liberti es of the three  black  stones  proves  to
be fatal.
Failure 1. D oing Black a favor
The hane  of Whit e 1 is an overplay This
makes  Black's original play on the 2-2 point
into a good  move . The open  conn ection of
Whit e 3 is the only  follo w-up. Afte r Black  6,
a ko follo ws with  White 'a'. If instead of 3,
Whit e conne cts tigh tly at b',  he can't  even get
this ko.
Failure 2. Turning
White 1 is also looks strong,  but Black an-
swers  with  a hane at 2 and a desc ent to 4, a
shape  which cannot  be killed
unco nditionally. As we saw in the very  first
pattern  of this section, the best White can do
now  is atta ch at 'a' to get a ko.
