Pattern 24
Black to play and live
This is a relatively  easy class of life and
death  problems,  but if you don't  exercise
some caution with the first move, the large
numbe r of variat ions might  make you feel
as if you're  lost in a maze.
Solution 1. Op en connection
The open connection at Black  1 is the vital
point  for making  eye shape. As long as you
know  this move,  there  is noth ing particul arly
difficult which follows. In answer to White's
diagona l move at 2, Black defends at 3 and very
efficiently makes two  eyes. The role of the
marked bla ck stone is particu larly impor tant.
Solution 2. Whit e's attachment
White can't  hope  to achieve anyth ing unless
he attaches  with  2, but Black  counters  with 3.
Whit e ataris  at 4, but Black  gets two eyes  with
5.
Failure 1. Turning
If Black could turn at 1 and live, then  there
would n't be any problem  here, but White
makes  the placeme nt at 2 and Black  cannot
make  two eyes. Black tries  to expa nd his eye
shape  to the maximum  extent  with Black 3 and
5, but White responds  with 6 and 8 and it
doesn't  work.
