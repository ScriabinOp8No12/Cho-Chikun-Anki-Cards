Failure 2. Ope n connection
After Black  1 and Whit e 2, what about  the
hand  and open connection of Black 3 and 5? If
Whit e continues at 'a' and Black  connects at 'b',
making  a ko, then  this would also be a possible
solutio n. That is not, however, the way  things
will procee d. Whit e has the clever attack shown
in the next diagr am.
Failure 3. D escent kills
After the prev ious diagram, White's descent
at 1 is a deadly move. After Black fills his gap at
2, White plays 3 and,  in response to Black's
descent  to 4, throws  in at 5, turnin g the left side
into a false eye.
If instead  of 2, Black  plays  3, you should
verify for yourself that after White 'a', Black 4,
and the atta chment at Whit e 'b', Black  is dead.
Failure 4. Stra ightforward
What about begin ning with the hane  and
open  connection of Black 1 and 3? This,
howe ver, is not a very resilient shape.  White  s
hane  at 4, cut at 6, and atari at 8 kill Black
easily.
Reference 2. Turn
After Black 1 and White 2, take a look  at
Black's  turn at 3. This is quite a tenacious  shape.
How should  White attack this group?  If
Whit e had a stone  at 'a', then  without  bother ing
to make  a ko, he would  simply capture  the
black group uncon ditionally. Lets deal with this
in our next  pattern.
