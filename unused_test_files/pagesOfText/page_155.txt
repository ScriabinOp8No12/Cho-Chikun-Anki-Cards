Pattern 11
White to p lay, Black d ies
This is simi lar to the last pattern,  but the
situation with the outs ide liberties of the
black ston es is different Because of this,  the
vital point has become somew hat uncerta in,
but there certai nly is one.
Solution 1. Place ment
The placeme nt at White 1 is the vital point
After Black connects at 2, Whit e cuts and
captures  with 3 an d 5 and  Black  is dead.
There  is no margin for Black  to use 2 to make
the open  connection at 'a'. If he does, Whit e cuts
at 2 and captures  the two black stones  in the
corner.
Solution 2. Res istance
In answe r to White  1, attachi ng at Black 2 is
powerfu l; howe ver, crawl ing at 3 is a good
move  and after Black  4, Whit e cuts at 5. Though
Black  descend s to 6, Whit e follows at 7, so Black
cannot save his two  stones.
If White cuts imm ediately with 3 at 5, Black
can live by playi ng 'a'.
Solution 3. Si mple
Answering White 1 with Black  2 doesn't
really  put up all that much resis tance. After
exchan ging White 3 for Black 4, White play s a
hane  at 5.
