Solution 3. A frau d
After White 1, Black 2 can also be a some-
wha t confus ing response.  Howe ver, calmly
play ing a hane at 3 is good enough.  If Black
continues with 4, the placement at 5 limits
Black to only  one eye.
Whit e can also play  3 immediately at 5.
Solution 4. Beginning with  a placement
Going  back to the very  beginning, White
can also begin  with the placement inside at 1
here. After  Black 2, White blocks  at 3 and
Black's situation  is hopeless.  If Black  tries 4,
Whit e descends  at 5.
Solution 5. Rejecti ng ko
After White 1 to 3, should Black  attach at 4,
Whit e mus t be careful how  he responds. He
must, without  fail, descend  to 5. Then  after
Black 6, play ing a hane at 7 kills the black
group.  If Whit e carelessly tries to link under
with 5 at 6, Black  throws in at 5 and  gets a ko.
Failure 2. Hon e and connect
This is a classic example of a Whit e failure.
If White plays  the hane and conne ction of 1
and 3, then by desce nding at 4, Black sur-
vives. Even  if White next plays at 'a', after
Black 'b', White 'c' and Black 'd', White's stone
is captured.
