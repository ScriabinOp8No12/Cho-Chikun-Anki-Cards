Pattern 13
White to p lay, Black d ies
It appears  that Black has enough  room  to
live, but this shape has a weak point  You
need to be very careful about  your  order  of
move s. Black  can put up some unexpectedly
tenacious  resistan ce about  halfway  through,
so be carefu l.
Solution 2. Combination
The hane at 1 and the placement  at 3 are
the correct combi nation After Black  4, White
5 is Black's  Achilles heel  Whe n Black tries to
make an eye at 6, White desce nds at 7, re-
strict ing Black to just one eye.
Failure 1. Approach-move ko
Instead of Black  6 in the previous diagram,
Black 1 in this diagram is an important
variation If White follows along  carelessly
and blocks at 2, Black  makes  an eye with 3.
This is still an approach -move ko for Black,
but if you consider that group was originally
unconditionally dead, an approa ch-move  ko
can be called  a failure for White.
Solution 2. Three-space big eye
After Black  1, White's placement at 2 is the
way  to deal with Black's resistan ce. Whe n
Black conne cts at 3, White also conne cts at 4,
then after Black  5, White has the connection
at 6. You can verify  for your self that this is
not a seki but a three- space big eye.
