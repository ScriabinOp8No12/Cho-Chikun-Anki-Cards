Pattern 14
White to p lay, Black d ies
This pattern is often seen in collections of
life and death  problems.  In this shape as
well, cursed with  the shortage  of liberti es of
his three  stones, the black  group  dies. How-
ever, be careful  not to jump  to conclusions.
Solution. Diagonal move
The diagonal move  of White 1 has a nice
feeli ng about  it. Afte r Black 2, White has the
hane  at 3. Black can't push  in at 'a' beca use of a
shortage of libert ies.
If Black plays 2 at 'a , then White plays 3 and
Black's  eye is still  ruined.
Failure. Careless
At first,  the attachment at White 1 might be
appeali ng, but it's a vulgar play and includes  an
illusion. Black  can push  at 2 and answer  Whit e
3 by conne cting at 4. It looks as if White, in the
early  stages,  overlooked  the fact that he cannot
connect at 'a'.
Reference. Making life for Black
If you wonder  how Black  should  play in this
positio n, as a matt er of course , he has to jump
to 1 here.  If he make s the open connection at 'a',
he ends  up dead as you'v e already seen.
