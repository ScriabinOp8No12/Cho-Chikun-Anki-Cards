Solution 4. A Simple Placement
The fact is, the simple  placement  at 1 also
kills the group.  If Black answers at 2, White
play s 3 and 5, in order  However, don't for-
get that when Black has a stone  at 'a' this
variation gives him the oppor tunity  to con-
nect to th e outside.
Solution 5. Playing hane  first
Whe n Whit e begins with 1, take heed of
Black's hane  at 2. Promptly throwing in at
Whit e 3 is important;  after Black  4,
defending at 5 kills the group.  If instead  of
3, White simply  defends  at 5, after  Black 'a'
and White  3, Black  will be able to live by
play ing 'b'.
Reference 1. Hane on the left
Next, let's look  at the position when
Whit e doesn't have a stone  at 'a'. After
Whit e 1 and 3, Black's  hane at 4 becomes
somethi ng of a problem. Needless to say, if
Whit e has a stone  in the vicinity of 'a', he
can ignore  a black hane  at 4 and play  the
diagonal attachment at 'b' to kill the group.
Reference 2. Ko
Whe n White cannot help but defend at 1,
Black makes  an eye at 2 and  is no longer un-
conditionally dead. Black answers 3 by con-
necting along the bottom  at 4 and gets a di-
rect ko.
If White blocks with 1 at 3, Black's  cut at
'a' w ill of cour se become a problem.
