Pattern 22
Black to play and live
This shape  looks similar, but there  are
some differences. You  can imag ine that
White has just played  a hane  on the left
side. Try to read  out the order  of Black's
move s all the way  to th e end.
Solution 1. The  same move
Black doesn't  really have any other  choice but
to begi n with the open  conn ection at 1. The
quest ion is, what  happens  after White makes
the placeme nt at 2?
In response  to Black  3, White will conn ect at
the bottom  with 4 and then  after Black  5, push
in at 6, but is Black  really  alive? Conti nuing in
the next  diagram —
Solution 2. Recaptu re
Black mus t not connect to the right of the two
stones.  Instead  he should simply  captur e a
singl e stone at 1. Then, when White captur es at
2, notice that Black  can recapture  with 3 to the
left of 2. It's because of the possibility of this
recapture  that  Blac k is aliv e.
Should Black  conne ct at 2, White  will start a
ko by  captur ing at 'a'.
Failure. Tight  connect ion
Connec ting at 1 mak es the black shape too
simple.  Once White plays the hane at 2 there  is
no way  for Black  to live. To continue, if Black
'a', Whit e 'b'.
In most  cases,  the open  conne ction creates
much  better eye-shape potential  than a solid
connection.
