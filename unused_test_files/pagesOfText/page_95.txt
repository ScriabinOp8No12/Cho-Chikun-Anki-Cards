Pattern 1
White to play. A Ten-Thousand-Year Ko
This shape  is one space  longer than  the 'L-
shape'. You  need  to learn  that when all of the
outs ide liberties of this group  have  been
filled in, it's possible for White to play  and
make  a ten-thousand -year ko. Of course,
you'l l also need to know what  is meant by
ten-thousand -year ko.
Solution. Belly attachment
Whit e's only  play  is the belly attachmen t
at 1. Whe n Black  plays  2, White crawls at 3.
Black's  hane  at 4 is at the vital point, and
Black  then  answers White 5 by descend ing
to 6. This  shape is known  as the ten-
thousand-year ko.
Now,  let's examine  the properties  of this
ko.
Reference 1. Suicida l
One  of the specia l characteristics of this
shape  is that is difficult for Black to make a
move  here.  If Black fills in a liberty at 1, for
example,  White captures  at 2 and starts  a
real ko for the life of the black group.
Before  playing  1, Black had better  be very
certain  of his ko threats.
Reference 2. The  right to choose
If Black decides not to make a move
here,  eventual ly White will fill in the
outside  libertie s and captur e at 'a' to start  a
ko. After  this,  if White wins the initial ko,
he has the option  of either  conne cting the
ko, to get a seki,  or filling in a black liberty
at 'b'  to make i t a tr ue ko.
