Solution 3. Straightforward
After Black 1 and  White 2, if Black
descends  at 3, living becom es unlikely. With
the Whi te throw -in at 4, Black dies.  Even if
Black captures at 'a', White can play
elsewhere,  because the shape  is dead as it
stands.
Solution 4. D iagonal Atta chment
In response to White's  placeme nt, the
diagonal attachment of Black  1 looks  like a
strong way to defend. How ever, White  cuts
at 2 and Black is unable to survive. White
answe rs Black  3 by turni ng at 4. Black  must
continue by playing at 'a', so there's  no time
for him  to play  at 'b'.
If Black  play s 3 at 4, White plays  at 3.
Solution 5. Throwing in
If Black  blocks  at 1, White throws in at 2.
When Black  plays 3, White cuts  at 4 and in
this case as well, Black  doesn't get to play at
'a' since his two  stones  are in atar i.
Note th at if Black  play s 1 at 2, White cuts at
4, and  we get a shape simi lar to the one in the
prev ious diagram.
Failure 2. Too late
Starting with the throw-in of White 1 may
look strong,  but it's a reading error.  Whe n
Black plays  2, it's too late for Whit e to make
the placement at 3. With  4 and 6, Black  man-
ages to li ve.
Having played  at 1, Whit e has no choice
but to block at 'a' and start a ko. Com pare this
with the following pattern.
