Failure 3. Black survives
As was mentio ned,  the hane at White 1 is a
mistake. Black 2 is the correct defe nsive play,
after which Black is unconditionally alive. 
In this diagram White fails  to punis h Black
properly for his mistake w ith his first move . 
Failure 4. Sudden death
The attachment of Whit e 1 is at the 2-1 vital
point  Black  has no choice but to try to expan d
his eye space with 2, but with White 3 this
shape becom es the fami liar bent  four in the
corner. 
Bent Four in the Corner (2)
Diagram 1: Let's just confirm that Diagram 1
ends in the dead  bent-four- in-the-corner
shape. 
At White's leisure he can fill in Black's out-
side liberty at 'a', then  continue with 'b' and 'c'
to make  a ko. This makes  Black  'conditionally'
dead. The condition, of course,  is that White's
surrounding stones  must be alive. 
Diagram 2: So th at you don't  confus e the bent-
four-in-the-corner  shape with the bent-four
shape which doesn't end up in a ko, take a
look  at Diagram  2. This is certainly a bent-
four-in-the-corner  shape,  but there  is no place
for White to play  and get a ko. This  shape does
not result in Black's  death; rather, it is a seki.
