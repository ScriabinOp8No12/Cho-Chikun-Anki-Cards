Pattern 4
Black to play and live
A leg has been  added to the basic 'L-
shape.'  Now,  if it's Black's turn, he can live.
Also, if it's Whit e's turn , he can kill
Black You should  learn how to do that as
well.
Solution 1. The  jump
There  are a few different way s for Black to
live, but the jump to Black 1 is the easiest to un-
derstand.  Even  if White tries to reduce  Black's
eye space with White 2 and 4, Black  3 and 5
produce  a living bent -four  shape.
Solution 2. Power less placement
After Black 1, White 2 is at the vital point, but
Black  defend s at 3 and has no problems. The
marked  stone works effectively, so White 2 is
also powerless  to k ill Black
Solution 3. Alive,  but. . .
Black can also live by turning at 1. White  2 is
met by descending to 3 and whe n White plays
4, Black plays 5. It's a gote  seki for White, but of
course  living uncond itionally is preferab le to
seki,  so the previous  diagram is better  for Black
In the middle of this seque nce, if White  plays 4
at 5, Black  plays  at 4.
