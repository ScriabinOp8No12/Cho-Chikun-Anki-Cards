Pattern 16
Black to play and live
It certai nly doesn't  appear  as if these
stones will be able  to live, but by playing
his first stone  at the vital point, Black can
hope  to save his stones.  It's important  to try
everything in your  pow er, right up to the
end.
Solution 2. Two good moves
The vital  point for the first move  is Black
1. If White descends  at 2, Blacks  hanes  at 3;
after White blocks at 4, the diagonal  play  at
5 is impor tant If White plays atari  at 'a ,
Black has the descent at 'b', which secures
two eyes.
Instead of Black  5 —
Failure 1. Open connecti on
Black woul d like to play the open  con-
nection at Black 1 here,  but if he does,  he
won't  be able  to li ve unco nditionally.
Whit e can play  the attachme nt at 2 and
in response  to Black 3, continue with the
hane at 4. After Black 5 and White  6, a ko
fight develops at 'a'. In this positio n, ko is a
failure for Black.
Failure 2. Black dies
Wha t if Black  answers  White 2 with 3
and 5, capturi ng one stone?  In this event,
the placement at Whit e 6 becomes  the vital
point.  Now , even if Black  conne cts at 7,
Whit e descend s to 8 and  Black  can no
long er make  an eye at 'a'. In either case,
Black 1 is a mistake.
