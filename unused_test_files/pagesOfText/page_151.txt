Pattern 8
White to p lay, Black d ies
Black's shape is the same  as before, but
the marked whit e stone  which has been
added  on the perimeter is menacing. By at-
tacking Black's  defect, you' ll have  no trou-
ble robbi ng him  of an eye.
Solution 1. Att aching  Underneath
The attachment at Whit e 1 is the vital point  If the
moves moves to 4 follow, then the five-space big
eye emerges.
If Black  play s 2 at 4, White pulls  back  at 2
and there is just no way  for Black to liv e.
Solution 2. Bel ly attachment
White can even  play  the attachment at 1 and
produce  a dead shape. When Black attaches  at
2, White 3 is the play  which aims at killing
Black  outright After Black 4, the attachme nt at
Whit e 5 works.  You  can see how  effective the
marked  white stone is. Playi ng White 3 at 'a',
letting Black play  at 3 and get a ko, is a mistake.
Failure. Place ment
White 1, which at first glance has the aura of
a vital  point, is powerless in this position  as
well. Black  responds  with 2 and 4 and the two
whit e stones  won't be able to conn ect to the
outside.
Even if Whit e switches 3 to 4, Black simply
blocks at 3 a nd it's all over.
