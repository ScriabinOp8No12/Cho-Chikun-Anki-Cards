Pattern 10
Black to play and get a k o
You can consid er this a practical application
problem for what  we've covered so far. This
shape comes  up in actual fighting  and is very
difficult to handle. There  are a number of
possibilities for the first move,  so you
should inve stigate  them  thoroughl y
Solution 1. The best move
Black's best move  is the descent  at 1.
How Whit e attacks in response to this is
shown in the next  diagram.
Befor e that, as an example  of the sim-
plest possible mistake, we have  a black
move  at 'a'. After that,  a white play  at 1
kills Black This is just com mon sense.
Solution 2. C lamp
After the last diagram, White's clamp  at
1 is a powerfu l mov e. Whe n Black plays 2,
White extends  at 3 and sets up a ko shape.
Black 4 and 6 start  a ko, as does simply
connecting at 6; next, either White 4, Black
5 or Whit e 5, Black 4 create  a ko.
Solution 3. Placement also possible
One more  possibility exists: White's
placeme nt mov e at 1. Black  must  attach  at
2, then White  3, Black  4, and sure enough,
ko.
If Black extend s at 3 instead  of 2, then
White 'a' and Black 4 follo w; White 2 now
produce s a nakade,  so Black  is dead.
