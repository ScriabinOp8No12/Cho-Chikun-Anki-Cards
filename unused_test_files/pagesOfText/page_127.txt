Pattern 23
White to p lay, Black d ies
It is obvious that the gap in Black's posi-
tion at 'a is a major weakness. For White,
the question is how to take advantage of it;
simpler is prob ably better
Solution 1. D ouble hane
The hane at Whit e 1 is sufficient If Black
pulls back at 2, White plays another hane at 3.
Beca use of the liberty  at 'a' you migh t not rec-
ognize  it, but this is also a versi on of the dead
L-shape.
Solution 2. Black dodges
Rega rding the position  after White's hane,
Black can think of several  ways to defend  him-
self. Of course , no matter  what he plays,  he
can t avoid dying, but White needs to know all
of the variations. For example , how  should
White respond to Black 2?
Failure 1. Vulgar
Playing atari at 1 is crass. Black  conn ects at
2 and now has managed  to get a living shape.
White has to connect at 3, so with 4 and 6
Black just manages  to live.
