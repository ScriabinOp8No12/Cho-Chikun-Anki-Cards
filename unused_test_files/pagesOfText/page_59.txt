Pattern 6
Black is alive
Hanes have been added to both  sides  of
Black's group.  This makes  the shape  more
tenacious.  Even if White makes the first
move , Black  will not die. Lets see just how
tenacious the group i s.
Variation 2. No linking under
First we'll look  at Whit e 1. In this case,  the
pres ence of the marked  black stone  means
White cannot  link underneath,  so Black  con-
nects  at 2, after  which things don't go well for
White. Taking  the vital points  at White  3 and
5 merely forces Black 6, and White  can do no
better than  seki.
Variation 2. Belly  attachment
If White begins with the belly attachme nt at
White 1, Black's  hane at 2 is good  enough.
When Whit e plays  3, Black conn ects at 4 and
once again White cannot link underneath  at
'a', so Black is alive.
Additionally, if White tries  begin ning with
'a', then Black  'b' and the seque nce White 1,
Black 2, White 3, Black  4 follows, leaving
Black alive.
Variation 3. An annoying  play
Wha t about  White  s placeme nt at 1? For
Black, this is probab ly the most trouble some
play.
Whe n Black connects, Whit e makes  the di-
agonal play at 3. Black's  hane at 4 is good , but
from Black  6 on, things become  a little compli-
cated. Black  8, not playing the ko, is a good  move . See the next  dia-
gram .
