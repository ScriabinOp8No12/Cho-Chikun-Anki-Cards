Pattern 2
Black to play and live
You  can think about  this as if White, in
the previous pattern, made the placement
inside as shown . This placement of White's
does n't work,  but it's easy for Black to make
a defensive mistake, so be carefu l.
Solution 1. The  bump
Play ing the bump  of Black 2 is good  enough,
but don't make a mistake after  this.  In response
to White 2, conne cting at 3 is impor tant Next,
after  Black  4, you mus t block from  this side
with  5, and  now,  since there is room  at 'a', Black
is alive. If Black plays  5 at 'b', White 'a' kills
him.
Failure. Careless
After Black 1 and White 2, be very  careful,
since it's easy  to block at 3. White extends to 4
and when  Black  connects at 'b', in order to de-
fend  against  a white  threat  to captur e by
playi ng 'a', White  plays  a hane at 'c', killing the
group.  You need  to understand  clearly  the
difference  betwee n this and playing Black 3 at
'b'.
Solution 2. Whit e is too late
In response  to Black  1, even if White  now
attaches  2, it doesn't  revert to a ko. Playi ng atari
at Black  3 is good  enough;  if Whi te then crosses
under  with 4, Black  conn ects at 5 and is
unco nditionally alive. If Black descend s with 3
at 4, it  becomes  a ko.
