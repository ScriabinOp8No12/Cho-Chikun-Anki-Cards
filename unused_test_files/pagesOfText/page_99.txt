Pattern 3
White to p lay, Black d ies
A white descent  to the edge of the board
has been added  to the left side of the black
group.  This descent  is powerfu l, so if White
attacks  persistentl y at the vital point, Black
will die. The quest ion is how to make  use of
the descent.
Solution 1. Turning
Turning at White  1, then answering Black  2
by strikin g at the vital point for making  eye
shape is good.  Since  Black  must answer  at 4,
White narrows  Black's base  with 5 and plays
hane at 7. In this position Black  cannot play at
'a' and he still has a cutti ng point  at b', so it
isn't a seki.  It's the dead thr ee-space  big eye.
Solution 2. Weak poin t
After White 1 to 3, Black 4 is the vital point,
but White still has the strong  move at 5. When
Black block s at 6, White connects at 7 and once
again, because  of his weak  point  at 'a', Black
cannot  survi ve.
Failure 1. Unconditionally alive
After White 1 and Black 2, Whit e 3 is the
wrong direct ion. Black  can play  the coun te-
ratari at 4 and sacri fice one stone  with 6 and 8.
Since he can't  even  make a ko, this is a terribl e
mistake for White.
