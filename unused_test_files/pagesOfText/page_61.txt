Pattern 7
Black to play and live
A 'leg' has been  added to the left side of
the 'L-shape.' In this case, if it's Black's  turn ,
he is alive, and if it's White's turn , he is
dead. We'l l investigate each case.
Solution 1. The  2-1 poi nt
Black 1 is one of the vital points  for Black  to
live. If White play s 2, Black 3. Whe n Whit e ex-
tends  to 4, widen ing his base at Black  5 is good;
in response  to White 6, Black 7 keeps  this from
becom ing the five-spac e big  eye.
If Black 5 is play ed at 7, Black is also alive,
but with less territory  and less endgame poten-
tial.
Solution 2. The  2-2 poi nt
Turni ng at Black 1 also lets Black  live.  After
Whit e 2 and Black 3, White  4 is the vital point,
but Black can bloc k at 5.
Addit ionally instead  of turning at 1, Black
can live by playing the diagonal  play of 4; how-
ever,  in response  to White 'a', he will have to
give  way  with Black 1, so this is somethin g of a
territoria l loss.
Failure 1. Ko
Black's descent  at 1 is a move which has bad
aji. Whit e's attachment at 2 becomes  the vital
point,  and after Black 3 and 5, he can't do any-
thing but make a ko .
If Black  plays 3 at 5, White answers  at 3; like-
wise,  if Black  tries  3 at 'a', White plays  at 4. Ei-
ther way,  Black is dead.
