Variation 2. A stru ggle
Conti nuing from the previous diagram,  even
if instead of playing elsewhere, Black uses 1 to
try to extricate  his stones  on the left side, de-
fend ing at White 2 is good  enough. Whe n Black
plays  3, Whit e fills in one of Black's  liberties
with  4, so Black cannot squash  White with 'a'. If
Black  captures  at 'b', White recaptures  and
Black  is still dead.
Reference 1. Tak e another look
This  is Pattern  20 again. At the time  we didn't
discuss  it, but what happens  here if Whit e
makes  the placeme nt at 1? Since at the time  1
said  'Black is alive; ' it wouldn't do for this
Whit e 1 to give a good  result.  How  should
Black  respond?
Reference 2. The  same technique
Black answers Whit e 1 with the attachme nt at
2 and Whit e's atari  at 3 with his own  atari at 4,
but he isn't  trying to start a ko. In this case,
whe n Whit e captur es at 5, Black  can connect at
6. The  seque nce cont inues in the next diagram.
Reference 3. Living  via double ko
From  White 7 to Black  10 is a one- way street,
then  Black answers  White 11 by blocking at 12.
This  is not an approach-move ko. Rather, it's a
double  ko, so Black  is alive.
You  should  try to dete rmine  for yoursel f
exactly  how this  differs from Pattern  23.
