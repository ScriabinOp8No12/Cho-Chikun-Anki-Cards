Failure 2. An error in the corne r
White 1 is the wrong order,  but after
White 3 capturin g the stone with 4 is
disastrous. In this event,  White pushes  in at
5 and Black  is dead . In the cont inuat ion,
Black 'a' is met by White  'b'.
Black 4 must be  at 'c'.
Failure 3. Black doesn't die
Simply playing  atari at Whit e 1 has to be
called vulgar  Black connects at 2 and now
Black won't  die without  exacting a price.
Answering White's hane at 3 by turning at
4 is good;  with the sequence from  5 to 9,
White does threaten  to kill the black group,
but after Black  10 it's merely an approach-
move ko.
Failure 4. Just for the recor d
Just in passing, in this posit ion, defendin g
with Black 1 at the 2r1 point  is dangerous
because of to Black's  shor tage of libert ies.
After White 2 and 4, Black cannot block at
'a'. However,  if captur ing at Black  5 is sente
for Black, he makes it possible for himse lf to
play at 'a' and  live.
Failure 5. No way
Return ing to the origi nal pattern,  White's
hane  at 1 is certai nly hopeless. Black 2 is the
vital point  White can play  3 and 5, but at
worst Black defend s at 'a' and gets a ko. If
the capture  at 'b' is sente  for Black,  he can
answe r White  5 at 'c' and li ve.
