Solution 3. H ane kills
In this positi on as well, the hane at White
1 is intelligent If Black steps  down  to 2, you
can readily  see that the attachme nt at 3 i s the
vital point  Next,  if Black  'a', White b' serves
the purpose.
Also, if instead of 2 Black  conne cts at 'c',
White 'd', Black 'b', White  'a' is good e nough.
Failure 2. Black is alive
Pushing at White  1 is also vulgar  After
Black 2, the hane is correc t in this position,
but when Black  plays  the open conne ction at
4, there  is no long er any way  to kill  him.
Additionally, conti nuing from  this posi-
tion, we have  the follo wing variat ion.
Failure 3. It's powerful, but...
White's place ment at 1 is a way  to
continue to harass the black group.  If Black
2, connecting along  the bottom  at 3 is
pow erful, but after Black  4 and White 5,
Black captur es at 6 and is alive. If Black
connects at 'a' instead  of 6, White captur es at
'b', and  since Black  cannot atari at 6, it's a ko.
Failure 4. Simple
The belly attachme nt at White 1 is also a
vulgar play When  Black  conn ects at 2, even
if White links underneath  at 3, Black  4 and 6
are sente; with the diagonal move at 8, Black
is alive.
