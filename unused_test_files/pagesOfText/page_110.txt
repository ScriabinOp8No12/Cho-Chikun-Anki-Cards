Solution 3. Anoth er possibility
Instead  of 5 in the previous  diagram,
Whit e could  also turn at 1 here. Since  Black
will die if White  conti nues at 2, he must
throw  in at 2 himself, with a ko as the result
Of course,  in the event that Whit e wins the
ko fight, the aji of the previous diagram  is
better  for him.
Solution 4. The  third poss ibility
The  third  method  is the placeme nt at
Whit e 1. Black must attach at 2, then  White 3,
Black  4 yield a ko. Aft er White 5, if  Black con-
nects  at 'a', White either cuts at 'b' or connects
at 'c', aiming  at a five-space  big eye. In either
case,  it continues to b e a ko.
Reference 1. Two  routes
Black  has an extra liberty  at 'a'. Despite
this,  if it's his turn  to play White can still
force  a ko, but of the three  ways  to make a ko
show n so far, only  two still work  Whi ch one
do you thin k no longer  works?
Reference 2. Aliv e
The white placeme nt at 1 no longer pro-
duces  a ko. This  is because , after Black 2 and
Whit e 3, Black can now play  at 4, then  de-
scend  to 6. In response  to Whit e 7, Black
plays  atari at 8 and is alive. When  the liberty
at 'a' is filled in, White  responds  to 6 at 'b',
then  Blac k 'c' and  White 7 pro duce a ko.
