Pattern 26
Black to play and live
You  first  need to determ ine whet her or
not you can live by simply  securing the base
that you have.  If this won't  allow you to
live, then  you have no choice but to search
out th e vital  point for making  eye sha pe.
Solution. Ope n connection
With the open connection at 1, Black  very
efficiently acquires two eyes.  As far as the eye
in the corner is concerned, take  a good  look  at
how  effectively the marked black stone  is
worki ng.
Failure 1. The  place ment technique
The conn ection at Black  1 secures the base of
the black group,  but because  of the shor tage of
liberti es of the four  black stones,  it invites
Whit e 2. After Black 3, White  can cut at 4 and
Black  cannot atari.
If White plays  a hane  with  2 at 3, Black lives
with  Black 2, Wh ite 4, an d Black  'a'.
Failure 2. Ko
The descent  to Black  1 also expands  Black's
base,  but after  White  throws in with  2, there  is
no way  for Blac k to li ve. The open  connection at
Black  3 is his best response  and the moves  to 6
produces  a ko.
In addition, playing Black 1 at 'a' is also met
by White 2, with  Black 'b' up to Whit e 6
resulti ng in a ko.
