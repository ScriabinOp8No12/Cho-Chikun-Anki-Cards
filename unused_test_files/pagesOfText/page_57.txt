Pattern 5
White to p lay, Black d ies
Since the last pattern, Black's hane has
been  added  to the shape. Because  of the
pres ence of this hane,  some of White's
killing moves  have been elim inated.  Where
should White  make his first play ?
Soluti on 1. The plac ement
In this shape,  the placement at White  1 is
one strong  move.  When  Black plays  2,
White extends  at 3, Black  4, White  5, Black
6, White 7 leaves  Black dead.
If White 1 at 2, Black  plays  the diagonal
attachment at 3, then  Whit e extends  to 2
and Black  is still dead.
Solution 2. Even the hane  works
Even the combination of the hane at
White 1 and the vital  point  of 3 leaves Black
dead . The likel y cont inuation is Black 4,
White 5, and now  Black  cannot leave  out 6,
so White throws  in at 7.
If instead  of 4, Black  crawls to 5, White
extend s to 4.
Solution 3. Evasion
After White 1, if Black dodges to 2, White
makes the placeme nt at 3. Next  he can an-
swer Black  4 at 5.
In additio n to these possib ilities, if, in-
stead of 2, Black decides to make the diago-
nal play  at 3, White jumps in at 2 and Black
is still dead.
