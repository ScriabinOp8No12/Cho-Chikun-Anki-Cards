Variation 4. Squee ze play
Continuing from  the previous  diagram,
throwing in with Black 1 is advisable. In re-
sponse  to White 2, Black can conne ct at 3,
and when White captures  at 'a', Black  can
atari at 'b' instead  of fight ing a ko.
Even if White uses  2 to capture
imm ediately at `a',  Black 'b' is good  enough.
Variation 5. The diagon al move
Whit e's quietly descending to 1 is also  a
play  which Black needs  to answer  careful ly
The diagona l move  of Black  2 is correct,  mak-
ing miai of 'a' and 'b'.
Black 2 is the only way for Black  to be sure
of living, so be caref ul.
Failure 1. A weak point
Instead of the open conn ection, wha t about
descending to Black  1? This  play, however,
creates a weak  point  and whe n White play s
2, Black is at a loss.  White will answer Black
3 at 4 and, needle ss to sa y, Black  is dead.
Failure 2. A bad move
Let's imagi ne that before  making  the hang-
ing conn ection, Black  forces  by turn ing at 1
in sente.  When Whit e blocks at 2, Black plays
3. After  this Black might well think  he can
live easily,  but he is mistaken.  Black 1 is a
blunder The reasons  why  will be the topic  of
the next section.
