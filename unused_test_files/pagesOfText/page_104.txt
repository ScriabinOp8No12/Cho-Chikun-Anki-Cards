Variation 3. M issing the vital point
The placeme nt at White 1 misses  the vital
point.  Black  2 and 4 are the best answer;  up to
6, this  is not a seki;  Black  is alive.
If instead  of 2, Black  answers White 1 at 4,
Whit e 2, Black  6, and White 'a' end up being in
a seki.
Variation 4. Similarly
This  White  1 also misses  the vital point Black
blocks at 2 a nd White has m issed his chance.
The upshot of all this is that White can't hope
for anythi ng more  than  a seki,  and getting that
seki  in sente by following Variation  1 is the
correct  procedure.
Seki versus  Ko
Suppos e we set up a problem as in Diagram
1 and ask, "If it's White s turn  to play, what
is the result?"
The correc t answer,  of course,  is that Whit e
blocks at 1, Black throws  in at 2 and White
captures at 3, making  a ko.
As an alternative, White could  also play 1 at 2,
with Black answer ing at 1 to create a seki, but,
as I've mentio ned before, seki means that Black
is alive, so it's a failu re for White.
In a game,  if a ko fight  is not in  White's best
interests  because  of a lack of ko th reats,  then
making  a sente seki might  be reasonable,
but that is a separate  issue  from  the
evaluat ion of life and death  prob lems.
