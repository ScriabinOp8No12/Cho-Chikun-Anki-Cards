Reference 1. The L-shape
Now lets consider  how White, if it's his
turn, should play  to kil l Black
If you understand  the previous  pattern,
which is one of the most fundamenta l,
then the discussion is simple . If White
play s a hane  at 1, the shape reverts back  to
the L shape, so simply answer Black's re-
sponse s by attacki ng at the vital point  For
example, if Black  tries 2, White 3.
Reference 2. Placem ent at the vital point
After White 1, if Black  turns at 2, White
makes the placeme nt at 3. After Black  4, ei-
ther White 5, then  7, or White 7, Black  5,
Whit e 'a' kil l Black.
Reference 3. Belly attachment
Since  there are ways to kill the Black
group other  than  with  a hane,  for the sake
of clarity, lets c over some of them.
Whit e's attachme nt at 1 is okay  If Black
2, White descends at 3, aiming to link un-
der to the left Whe n Black  plays  4, Whit e 5
ruins his eye shape.
Reference 4. The 2-1 point
Whit e also can make the placement at 1.
If Black 2, White extends  to 3, and after
Black 4, White 5 to 7 is the conti nuation.
Learning the killing technique of the
hane is the easiest,  but learning these other
measures, as well , is certain ly not wasted
effor t.
