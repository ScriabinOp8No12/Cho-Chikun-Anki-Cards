Pattern 20
Black is alive
No matter how  frail this black  group ap-
pears, it is very efficiently alive. If only be-
cause this position comes  up often in actual
play, you should learn  to recogni ze it as a
basic living pattern .
Variation 1. The  open connectio n
If we begin with White's turn, then  White 1 is
normal.  Black's  open connection at 2 makes
good  shape,  making a group  which is impossi-
ble to kill. Hav ing said this, howev er, White
can still launch an effective attack  against  the
black group. L ets investigate this a little further.
Variation 2. R esponding to the attachm ent
After the last diagra m, Whi te 1 is the vital
point  for destroy ing the eye shape. In response,
howe ver, Black lives easily with the hane at
Black  2, fol lowed by Black 4 an d 6.
There  should  be a better  route  for White than
this.
Variation 3. A trou blesome play
The placement at White 1 can be troubl esome
for Black If he's not caref ul, he could  end up
dead.
There  is no other  choice for Black 2, but how
should  Black  respond to Whit e's descent at 3?
Play ing at 'a' is rash since White will throw in
at 'b'  and  forc e a ko.
