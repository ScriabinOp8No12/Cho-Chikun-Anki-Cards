Variation 2. The open  connection
The open  connection at Black  1 is a move
which at first glance you might think  makes
a lot of eye shape. Howe ver, the cut at
Whit e 2 is the vital  point,  and when Black
play s 3, White answers with the hane at 4.
Once again, there  is no way  to live
unconditionally Since Black  can't  simply
connect at 'a', a ko fight starts after  Black  'b',
Whit e 'a'.
Failure. An open liberty
In Pattern  22, the solut ion was the place-
ment at White 1. In this case,  however, even
if you follow the same sequen ce as before
up to 6, Black  manages to live. If White
continues with 'a', Black plays  'b'.
The status of Black's outside  liberti es is
different  than in the last pattern.
Reference 1. Same type
Once again  we've  changed  the shape
slightly In this case as well, White force s a
ko by throwin g in at 1. After Black 2 and
Whit e 3, once again the hanging conne ction
at 4, produci ng a two-step ko, is Black's best
move.
Reference 2. Alive
Even though the placeme nt at White 1 is
at the vital point,  after  Black 2 and White 3,
Black will connect at 4 and White  falls just
shor t. Having the marked  black stone in
place is a big plus for Black
