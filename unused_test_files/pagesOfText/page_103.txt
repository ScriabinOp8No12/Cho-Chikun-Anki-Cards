Pattern 5
Black is alive
There are no defects  in Black's perimeter
wall. He is affected somewhat by a shortage
of liberties, but even  if it's White's turn  to
play he cannot kill the black group. The best
possible attac k only  produces  a seki.
Variation 1. Seki
There  seem to be a few vital points and
Whit e 1 is at one of them.  Black must  answe r
without  fail by jumping  to 2, then  answer 3 by
connecti ng und erneath at 4. U p to 6 is  a seki.
If Black  plays  4 at 5 instead, White  will block
at 4 and get the dangerous ten thousand-year
ko.
Failure. Defensive error
Defend ing against White 1 by blocking at 2 is
also dangerous.  White  will hane at 3, and, sure
enough,  has now created  some  ko aji. If it is
now  White's move , he can play 'a' and 'b' to
start  a ko; even if Black plays  atari at 'c' before
Whit e 'a', White  connects at 'd' and the play
what  'd' remains.
Variation 2. The  2-1 point
White 1 here  is also one of the vital points.
Black  has to respond  at 2, and with 3 and 5
Whit e makes an eye for himse lf in the corner,
making  this also a seki. Note,  howe ver, that in
this case, it's a gote seki  for Whit e.
If Black bumps  into White at 'a' instead  of 2,
Whit e will hane at 2, giving the same result as
in the previous diagram.
