Pattern 9
White to p lay and make a ko
In this shape  Black has extended  towards
the left side and expanded  his territory,  but
this still doesn't give  him a perfe ct shape.
White attacks  in exactly the same manner as
before.
Solution. The same idea
Once  again,  the belly attachment at White 1
does the  job. Black 2 to Whit e 5 produc e a ko.
Instead  of 2, if Black conne cts at either  'a' or
4, White descends to 2 and is able to make  a big
eye. A lso, if Black  uses 2 to d escend at 'b', White
3 kill s him.
Failure 1. Leis urely
As befor e, if White makes  the place ment at 1,
Black  defends  at 2 and there is nothing White
can do. B lack lives comfortably with 4.
White 1 at 'a' is unima ginative: Black blocks
at 'b'  and  lives.
Failure 2. The  vital paint , but —
White's placement at 1 is also at one of the
vital points,  but when Black still responds  with
2, Wh ite has no follo w-up.
If Black  tries  to play stylis hly by attaching at
'a', Whit e ataris at 'b', givi ng Black no choice but
to play  a ko with  'b'.
