Pattern 28
White to p lay and make a ko
The differe nce betwee n this position and
the last one is the presence  of Black's  hane
on the edge of the board.  The problem,  you
could  say, is how Black should  make use of
it. There are two alternatives for White's at-
tack.
Solution 1. The  small-knight jump
Once  again, the small-knight jump  to White 1
is correct.  Afte r Black  2 to 4, the placement at
Black  5 is Whit e's best play this time.  After
Black  mak es eye shape  with 6, White pushes  in
at 7 and makes  a ko. You can probab ly assume
Black  'a' and White  'b' starting a direct  ko.
Failure. The effect of the black hane
The attachment at White 1 was the solution
to the previous pattern,  but this time it's a
mistake.  After Black  2 and White 3, Black  4 is a
calm  answer  and  now,  ironically, White  1
doesn't  wreck Black's  eye shape. The pow er of
this single hane  is tremend ous.
Solution 2. The  large-knight  jump
White can also make the large-knig ht jump  to
1. Playing 2 to 6 is Black's  best  defe nse and
Whit e crawls at 7, again  making  a ko.
However,  if Black  wins this ko, he will
capture  at 'a', so compar ed to Soluti on 1, Black
comes  out sligh tly ahead.
