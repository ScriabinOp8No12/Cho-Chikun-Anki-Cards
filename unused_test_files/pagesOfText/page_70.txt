Reference 1. Descent on the oppo site side
Wha t about the case  when  White has de-
scended with the marked  white stone ? In
truth , this descent  is powerless.
There should  be no mistake  about  which
descent will have an effect on Black's position.
Reference 2. Alive
Lets try the attachment at White 1. After
Black 2 and Whit e 3, Black  can play atari at 4.
If White 5, Black  descends at 6. There  are no
obstacles to Black's  living.
Two-S tep Ko
The situatio n in Diagram 1 comes  up often  in
actual  play and is typica l of two- step ko
shapes. The ko fight starts with White  s
throw-in at 1 and Black's  capture  at 2.
The shape  in Diagram 2 is the result  of White 's
play ing a ko threat somew here and retaking
at 1. After this,  Whit e cannot resolve the ko by
making one more move  in this area. In order
to win this ko, White must further  take the ko
at 'a', then  captur e at 'b' to settle things. Liter-
ally, it's a ko of two steps, and to that extent
Black has a lighter  burden than he would  if it
were a direct  ko.
