Pattern 19
White to p lay, Black d ies
As you can see, the position  is thin,  but if
you  don't  give  it careful  cons iderat ion,
Black will be able  to live. It's a matter of
where to put the f irst stone,  but there  is on ly
one vita l point.
Solution 1. Place ment
White's placeme nt at 1 is the vital point in
this  case. Black  2, stopping  White from
connecting to the outs ide, is his only  response,
but the hane  at 3 and attack  on Black's  shorta ge
of liberties with 5 are clev er.
Solution 2. Cro ssing under
If Black answers  White 1 with the open
connection at 2, White  crosses under at 3 and
it's all over.
Anot her possibility, Black 2 at 'a', is also
answered  by White  3. In the same manner, if
Black  plays  2 at 3, White  pushes  in at 'a' and
Black  dies.
At any rate, White 1 is a magnificent vital
point.1
Failure 1. H ane
Is beginning with the hane at White 1 so bad?
If Black turn s at 2, Whit e makes the placeme nt
at 3, wh ich reverts  to Solutio n 1.
White 1, howe ver, is badly timed.  Black  has a
better  way  of defe nding than  this.
