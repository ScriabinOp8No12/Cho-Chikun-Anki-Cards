Pattern 31
Black to play and live
This is a shape which seems very likel y to
occur  in actual  play  The positio n looks  quite
thin, so unless  you play  at an extremely effi-
cient  vital point, living will be difficult The
hane  on the left side is  Black's lifeline.
Solution 1. Ret reat
Black has to retreat at 1. In answer to White's
slide  to 2, Black blocks at 3. After  White
exchan ges 4 for Black 5, Whit e can't play  at 'a,
so Black  just barely manages  to live. Black must
be careful, because  if White later  gets a chance
to play  at 'b', he can then  play  at 'a' and kill the
black group.
Solution 2. Mi sleading
Can't  White try for a big eye instead  of 4 in
the previous  diagr am? For example, something
confu sing like White  1 here. Unfortunate ly,
Black  block s at 2 and answers  White 3 by
capturi ng a stone  with 4 and is alive. Should
Black  careles sly conne ct at 'a', Whit e plays 'b'
and Black dies unexpec tedly.
Failure. Missing the vital poin t
Black's descent  to 1 missed the vital point
Whit e throws  in at 2 and Black no long er has a
living shape.  When Black pulls  back at 3, Whit e
attaches  at 4.
Addit ionally, connecting at 'a' instead of
Black  1, is met by a white slide to 'b', so Black
dies.
