Pattern 16
White to p lay, Black d ies
This is also a practic al-applic ation prob-
lem. This  time  it's Whit e's turn.  If you have -
a good feel for shape you probably won't
have  any trouble . It's all over if you know
where to make the  first move.
Solution. Larg e-knight  move
White 1 kills the group  at one blow If Black
makes  an open  connection with Black 2, White
connects to the outside  at 3; 'a' won't become  an
eye for Black, ao there  are no more  proble ms
here.
If White turns at 'b' instead  of 1, the jump to
Black  1 is the vital point
Failure 1. Sma ll-knight  move
If White slides in with the small  knight' s
move  at 1, all of a sudden  the variations
become  com plicated.
Black's attachment at 2 is his strongest
response.  White, too,  has no choice but to
cont inue his attack with 3, but what  happens
after  Black  blocks  at 4?  After White 5...
Failure 2. Whi te is trapped
Black attac hes at 6. Up to 10, Black traps  two
whit e stones beca use of their own  shortage  of
liberti es.
The conc lusion is that,  the small- knight  move
allows Blac k to survive.
