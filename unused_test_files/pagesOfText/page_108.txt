Pattern 9
White to p lay and get a k o
Black has an extra liberty in the midd le of
his formatio n, so things won't  go as they
did in the last pattern.  Whit e will reinfor ce
his positi on surroundi ng the black group
and use a practical fighting technique to
start a ko.
Solution. Two- step hane
The two-step hane  of Whi te 1 and 3 is the
answer.  In response  to Black 4, Whit e goes  all
out with the atari at 5. When  Black  captures  at
'a', a ko fight  begins.
Failure. The extra liberty
If White plays  the hane and connection of 1
and 3, Black descends  to 4. This  time, however,
whe n White cont inues with 5 and 7, Black's ex-
tra li berty  allows him  to pl ay atari at 8 and  live.
Addit ionally if Whit e begins  by descendi ng
to 3, Black blocks at 1 and the shape reverts to
Pattern  2 of  this sectio n.
Reference. Black' s hane
In an actual  game,  if Black  has an
opportunity  play ing the hane at 1 makes his
positio n safe.  If White  answers at 2, this
exchan ge alone  has eliminated  White's means
of starting  a ko .
