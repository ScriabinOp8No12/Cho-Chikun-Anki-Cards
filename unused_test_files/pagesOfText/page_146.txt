Pattern 5
White to p lay, Black d ies
On the left side  of his positio n, Black
played the open  conne ction instead  of de-
scendi ng. Com paring  the descent  with  the
open connection, each has its plushes and
minuse s, but somehow  the minuses  of the
open connection seem greater  If it's White 's
turn  to play,  Black  dies unconditionally.
Solution. Crush ing
The answer  is the attachment at White 1,
decisi vely crushi ng Black's  eye shape.  After
Black  2, Whi te hanes  at 3 and Black doesn't
have  enough space  in which to live. The con-
tinuati on is Black  'a', White 'b'. I'm sure  it's
readily  appa rent that  this  is not a ko.
Failure 1. Resi sting
It would  be easy  in this positi on to slip up
by almost automatica lly play ing a hane at 1.
Black  can answer  this, however, by resisting
with  2; when White hanes  again at 3, he
blocks at 4 to g et a ko.
Failure 2. Thinki ng too hard
In attach ing at 1, White was thinking too
hard.  Black  can resist  with  2, and answer
Whit e 3 by connecting at 4. When  White de-
scends  to 5, connecting solidly at 6 is a calm
response;  with White  'a', all White gets is a
gote seki.
If Black play s 6 at 'a', White  throws in at 6
and Black dies.
