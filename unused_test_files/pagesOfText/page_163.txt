Pattern 17
Black is alive
If you  compare this to the first comb
shape,  the shape  has become a little bit
smaller. This  is a position which comes up
often  in actual  play.  Black is alive here even
if he plays elsewhere.
Variation 1. H ane
If White decides to try and captur e the black
group,  he will play  the hane  at White  1, but
Black  simply  connects at 2. In answe r to White's
placeme nt at 3, Black 4 is important  White's
craw ling at 5 produces  a scary position for an
insta nt, but Black connects at 6 and captur es the
Whit e stone  at 3.
Variation 2. Perverse
Black can also answer  White  1 with the open
connection at 2. Connecti ng on the bottom  with
3 is a nasty  play:  Black must pay close  attention.
Play ing either  at 4 or at ' a' is a cool  response.
If Black plays  4 at b', White throws  in at 'a
and kills him.
Variation 3. Placem ent
White's place ment at 1 is a confusing play
but if Black makes  the open conn ection at 2, he
has nothi ng to worry  about
If White mak es his place ment at 2, Black also
makes  an open conn ection, this time  at 1, and
Whit e has no answer.
