Variation. Five -space big eye
After White 1 and 3, a black descent  to 4 is
a mistake. White's turn  to 5 is the vital point
You can verify for yourself  that the result  will
be a five-space  big eye, so Black is dead.
Failure. Hane
Back at the beginning, playi ng a hane  at
White 1 is a mistake. After Black 2, Whit e 3 is
at the vital point,  but after  the continuation to
Black 8, even if White  conn ects at 'a', all he
gets is a seki.
The Ten-T housand- Year Ko
Diagram 1 shows  the completed  ten
thousand-year  ko formation. Unless Black
has a guaranteed  plan for winning it, play ing
Black 'a' to force  White to begin  the ko fight
at b' will only shorten  his life.
If White wishes to begin the ko, he will start
with 'b', and later  he can play  at 'a' to start  a
real ko, but whether  or not he will do so is
his decision.
If neith er side is certai n of his ko threats,
and both are unw illing to initiate such a
fight, then  White will captur e at 1, as in
Diagram 2 and conn ect to the left of 1 to make
a seki.
