Pattern 8
White to p lay, Black d ies
A hane has been  added  to the left side of
Black's group.  For this reason,  Black's  group
is going to provide stubbor n resistance,  and
White is left with only  one method  of
killing it Where  is White's first move?
Solution 1. Belly attachment
The only move  is the belly attachment at
Whit e 1. When Black  plays  2, White's de-
scent to 3 is a good  move.  If Black continues
at 'a', White turns  at 'b', after which he can
get a five-space big eye. If Whit e carele ssly
jumps  diagonally to 'b' with  3, Black  throws
in at 3 and  gets a ko.
Solution 2. Thre e-space  big eye
After White's attachme nt at 1, Black's at-
tachment at 2 is a response  which displays
tena city. In response, White s descent  to 3 is
impor tant After  Black  4, White  5 and  7
make a three-space big eye.
Should  White play 3 at 4, Black gets a ko
with  3.
Failure. An o bstacle
Don't  jump  to the conc lusion that even
Whit e 1 will kill the group.  Black's turn at 2
is a good  move, and in response  to White's
placeme nt at 3, Black blocks at 4, so White
cannot conn ect at 'a'. The existence of this
variation is wha t makes  the presence  of the
marked bla ck stone  so tricky.
Should  Black capture  the stone  at 'a' with
2, White hanes  at 'b' and kills him.
