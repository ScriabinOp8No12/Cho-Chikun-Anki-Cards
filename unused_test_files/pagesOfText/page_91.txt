Pattern 24
Black to play and live
Those of you who are familiar with this
shape shouldn 't have any particular prob-
lem with this pattern. If you're not, there  are
a number  of possibilities for the first move ,
and finding the right answer may be sur-
prisingly difficult.
Solution. Turning
Turni ng at Black  1 is correct  White 2 is at the
vital point for eye shape, but Black can simply
block at 3. When White hanes at 'a , for an
insta nt it looks  as if he's going to be able to link
underneath;  however, Black 'b' is good  enough.
Don't  get rattled and use Black  3 to connect at
'b'. Also, if White plays a hane  at 'a' instead  of 2,
then  Black  plays  2.
Failure 1. It 's alive, but...
It does n't look as if Black  should  have  any
problems  if he begins with the open  connection
at 1, but  this  move  has a defect.
White's hane at 2 is a bit hasty, since Black
will play  3 and live. Instead  of 2, take a look  at
Whit e's response in the next diagram.
Failure 2. Ko
After Black  1, White's  placement  at 2 is a
good  move . If Black answers at 3, White
connects to the outsi de with  4 and after  this is
left with a throw-in at 6 to make a ko. Let's  just
say that in playi ng the open  connection at 1,
Black  misread the peculiarities of the corner.
