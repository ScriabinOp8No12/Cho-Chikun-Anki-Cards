Pattern 27
White to p lay, Black d ies
In this shape,  Black has five stones lined
up on the third  line. His base seems to be
fairly wide, but the white descent on the left
side is powerf ul, so if White  plays  first,
Black dies. The attack,  however, requ ires a
good bit  of technique.
Solution 1. Sm all-knight  move
Not jumpin g too far, just sliding in with the
small- knight move to White 1, is steady.
Atta ching with  Black 2, trying to make his base
as wide as possible, is Black's only choice.
Pulling back  with 3 shows  com posure. After
Black  4, White 5 occup ies the vital point  for
making  eye shape.  Black  6 is met by White  7
and 9. Black  is dead.
Solution 2. Place ment
Instead  of 6 in the previous  diagram , Black
jumps  to 1. White counters with the placement
at 2. After Black 3, White conn ects at 4. This is-
n't a seki;  it's a thr ee-space  big eye.
Failure 1. O rder of moves
Even if Whit e plays 1 and 3 correctly after
this it is still easy  to make a mistake. For
example,  White might first  hane at 5; when
Black  answers at 6, attaching at 7 looks as if it
will kill White, but appearances are deceptiv e.
Black  8 is a good  move and makes  Black
unco nditionally alive.
