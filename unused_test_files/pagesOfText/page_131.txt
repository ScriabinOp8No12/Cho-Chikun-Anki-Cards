Pattern 25
White to p lay, Black d ies
Using the previous  pattern  as a starting
point, in response to Whit e's hane Black  de-
fend ed by jumpin g down with the marked
stone. Since the variations are interesting,
they  are being dealt  with separately  Be care-
ful not to make a mistake and fall into the
trap.
Solution 1. Turn  upward s
In this position, starting with  the hane at 1 is
important  After Black  2, White  connects at 3
and Black  doesn't  have enough  room  to make
two eyes.
If White plays  1 at 'a', Black will block at 3
and live.
Solution 2. Black  can't make two eyes
If Black  play s 2, it looks  as if he's going to
live, but pushi ng once  at 3, then playing a hane
at 5 is good enough. Next,  if Black  conne cts at
'a', Whit e does likew ise at 'b'. It's tricky,  but
Black  can't capture  the Whit e stones  by creati ng
a shortage  of liberties.
Failure. On the contr ary...
You might  think that extend ing to White 1 is
the standard mov e, but, on the contrary  it just
gives  Black a chance to fight for surviv al. Next,
making  a notch  with 2 is a good response. Afte r
Whit e 3, Black  descends to 4, inviting Whit e to
play  5; Black 6 ca ptur es two of the white stones.
