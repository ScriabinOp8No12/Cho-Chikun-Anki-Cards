Pattern 21
White to p lay, Black d ies
White's block at 'a' has been removed
from the previous  pattern. The quest ion is:
can White  kill Black if it is his turn?  Obv i-
ously, if he simply blo cks at 'a', Black lives.
Solution 1. The placement is the vital point
The placeme nt at White 1 is again the
vital point  This  position  is confusing, be-
cause  Whit e has the placement at 'a , so
it's important  to take a close  look  at the
location  of Black's  libert ies. If Black
connects at 2, Whit e han es at 3.

Solution 2. Exp anding doesn't work
Black  1 probably provides  the strongest
resistanc e. However, White  2 robs  him of
his eye.  When Black expa nds his eye
space  with 3 and 5, White plays  6. The
end result  is the bent four  in the corner
we have alread y seen a number  of times .
Solution 3. Shor tage of liberties
After White 1, what happens if Black
immediately expands his eye space with
Black 2 and 4?
Whit e has the cut at 5. If Black  plays at
'a', Whit e 'b' is atari.  Black is plag ued by
his shortage of liberties.
