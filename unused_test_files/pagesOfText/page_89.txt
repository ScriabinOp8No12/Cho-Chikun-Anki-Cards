Pattern 23
White to p lay and get a k o
Once again the position has been slightly
modif ied. This time  the questi on is whet her
or not Whi te can do anythi ng if he gets to
play first With what  you'v e learned thus  far
you probab ly realize that a simple mov e is
not going  to be  successful.
Solution 1. Place ment
A straightforward play  would  be the hane
at 'a , but then  Black  makes  open  connection
at 1 and  lives.
The solution is the placeme nt at 1. Whe n
Black  attaches at 2, White  plays  atari at 3.
However, after this Black  gets an approach -
move ko.
Solution 2. On e-step appr oach-move ko
After the previous  diagram,  once Black
connects at 1, White is forced to captur e at 2.
Black  3 and 5 next are the right order Black
answers  White 6 by blocking at 7, and whe n
Whit e play s 8, Black  starts  the ko. But even
if Black  decides  to play elsewhere and let
Whit e play  at 'a', it's still a ko, so this is a
one- step appr oach-move  ko.
Variation 1. C onnection
In response  to White 1, lets look  at what
happens  if Black connects at 2. White s only
choice is to extend to 3. Black  continues by
expanding his base with 4 and 6, but White
7 to 9 make this  a dead s hape.
Since there  is still one aspect of this shape
which is unclear,  lets investigate it a little
further
