Pattern 4
White to p lay, Black d ies
Compa ring this to the previous  pattern,
Black's position is the same. However, the
location of the marked white stone  has been
move d one space  furth er to the left Even  so,
if it's White 's turn,  Black  dies. 
The ques tion is whet her to begi n on the
inside or the outs ide.
Solution 2. Fro m the inside
In this shape we are limited to attacking from
the inside with White  1. White answers Black  2
with  the attachment at 3, then,  in response to
Black  4, stretches  out inside with 5. As you are
probabl y already  awar e, the conti nuation of
Black  'a', White b' does n ot pr oduce an eye.
Solution 2. The  attachment works
After White 1, if Black tries  2, White  has the
attachment  at 3. This is where the influence of
the marked stone is demonstrated.  Black 4 is
answered  by White 5, then  Black  'a', Whit e b'
make a shape  which leads  to a fa lse eye.
Failure. Wrong order of moves
You migh t think that starting  with the attach-
ment  at White 1 gives you the same result, but
that is not the case.  From 2 to 6, Black captures
two stones. Next,  even if Whit e makes a false
eye out of the left side,  Black  has room  to make
an eye at ' a'. 
Take  carefu l note of the differe nce betwee n
this and  starting your attack  from  the inside.
