Failure 2. Bent four in the corne r
Following White 1, Black 2 looks  like a
good move,  but White  s placement  at 3 is at
the vital point, and the continuation to 7 pro-
duces the dead bent- four-in-the-corner  shape.
Whit e 3 at 6 lets Black  survive by making
eye s hape at 3.
Reference 1. The descent
Let's make  certai n that in the original pat-
tern, if it's Black's turn,  he is alive. If he's care-
less he could  end up dead, so he has to be
careful.
The descent to Black  1 makes the group
alive. If Whit e 'a', Black 'b'.
Black 1 at 'a', making  eye shape,  also makes
the group a live.
Reference 2. Dangerous
Althoug h it looks  similar, the descent  to
Black 1 is dangerous. White 2 turn s out to be
at the vital point,  and up to White  6 this is
once again bent  four  in the c orner.
Even if Black descends with 3 at 5, White
crawls at 6 and the  result is the same.
Reference 3. No way  to live
Here Black  has crawled one fewer space. In
this case,  even if he plays first,  he cannot  live.
Black 'a seems to be the vital point,  but after
the sequence White 'b', Black  'c', and White  'd'
the group i s dead.
