Failure. Dangerous
What  about  jumpi ng to Black  2 in re-
sponse  to Wh ite 1?
If Black  blocks  at 6, after  White's place-
ment  at 3 and push at 5, White plays  a hane
at 7. Now, unle ss Black's captur e and threat
to extrica te himse lf at 'a' is sente,  he dies be-
cause  of a shor tage of liberties.
Variation 4. A live
Black  6 in the previous  diagram  is a mis-
take.  If Black  descends  at 1, as show n here,
then  in response to White 2, he can play  atari
at 3, and despite  his shortage of libert ies he
is alive.
In any case, by following the simple  life-
making proce dure of Variatio n 3, there  can
be no mistake.
Variation 5. Beginning inside
Next,  wha t about  begi nning inside, with
Whit e 1? Black's hane at 2 is good  enough.
Whit e 3 aims at starting  a ko at 'a', but Black
can play  the atari  at 4 first,  elimin ating any
possibi lity of ko, then  descend to 6 and  live.
Variation 6. The  place ment
The white placeme nt at 1 is also a confus-
ing move.  The diagonal play at Black 2 is a
calm  answer If White 3, Black plays  atari at
4, and  thin gs revert  to the  previous  diagra m.
Instead  of 3, if Whit e extend s to 'a', Black
answers  at 'b'.
