Pattern 21
White to p lay, Black d ies
This is similar to the prev ious diagram,
but because Whit e has descended to the
edge on  the left side, Black has bad aji.
White's method  was seen previous ly in a
similar example.
Solution. Sacrifice cut
The combi nation of the cut at White 1 and
placement at 3 is the procedure  referr ed to.
When Black  captures  at 4, White pushes  at
5. At this point you can probabl y see that
this is the same  type  of shape as in the
prev ious pattern. Afte r White 5, answering
a black descent to 'a' with the diag onal play
at 'b' is good  enough.
Failure 1. Vital point first
After White 1 and Black 2, Whit e 3 is
wrong. Should Black capture  at 'a' with  4,
this reverts to the solut ion diagram, but
Black 4 turns out to be the vital point  and
Black is allowed  to live. Even if White plays
'b', Black simply  captures  at 'a', and it's all
over.
Failure 2. Undistingu ished
Pushing in at White 1 isn't very smart
Black connects at 2 and gets a living shape.
For Black  making  this tight  connection is
important, since if he play s the open
connection at 'a', he allows White to throw
in at 2.
Also, if Whit e play s 1 at b', Black  conne cts
solidly at 2 and  Whit e has no conti nuation.
