Failur e 2. Mi stakes on bot h sides
If Black thinks he'd better  hurry  up and
hane  at 1, he makes it impossib le for himse lf
to live. White blocks  at 2; if Black conne cts at
3, Wh ite's han e at 4 kill s the group.
However, White 2, and Black 3 are both
mistakes,  as will be demonstrated  in the next
few diag rams.
Failure 3. Ko
After Black  1 and Whit e 2, Black mus t step
down  to 3. White will play  atari  at 4, forcing
Black  to play  at 5, whi ch gives a ko.
If Black now decides  to play  at 'a' instead
of 5, White attaches at 'b' and Black is dead
unco nditionally.
Failure 4. Uncondi tional
The fact of the matter  is, Black  1 is such a
bad move  that it should  not even yield  a ko.
Whit e's placemen t at 2 is a good  answer,
after  forcing Black to connect at 3, blocking
at 4 is the best continuation. In response  to
Black  5, Whi te descends  to 6, making miai
out of  'a' a nd b'.
Failure 5. Uni nspired
The worst possible play  is Black's  descent
at 1, a totally  unimagi native move . White, of
course,  simply bloc ks at 2 a nd Black is dead.
Whe n Black  makes  a move  like this, it be-
comes  apparent  that he knows  nothing
about  the concepts of life and  death  in go.
