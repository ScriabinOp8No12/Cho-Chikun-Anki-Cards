Pattern 18
White to p lay, Black d ies
You'l l probab ly be able  to find  the vital
point quick ly, but be careful not to make a
mistake on the several move s which follow
There is also a possi bility of making a
mistake if you thi nk too much.
Solution. The 1-1 poin t
Simply making  the placement at White 1
is correct  After  Black 2, White 1, occupyi ng
the 1-1 point,  is a calm  answer.  If Black
connects at 4, White pushes at 5 and creates
bent  four in the corner.
Also, if Black uses 4 to block at 5, White
can throw in at 4 and make  it into a false
eye.
Failure 1. An overplay
Throwing in at 1, then making the place-
ment  at 3 looks like a tesuji, but when Black
fills in at 4, things go wrong.  After White 5,
Black throws  in at 6, then  answers  White 'a'
by squeez ing at 'b', so Black  survives.
Failure 2. The atari is vulgar
If White simply play s atari at 1, Black
connects  at 2, and since Black has an open
liberty at 'a', there  is no way to kill him
outright  White 3, Black 4, etc. produc e a ko.
Even if Whit e had a stone at 'a', Black an-
swers Whit e 1 at 3 a nd with White 'b', Black
'c', and again  it's a ko. Either  way,  White 1
is a mistake.
