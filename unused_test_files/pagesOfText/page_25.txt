Pattern 8
White to p lay, Black d ies
Once again,  the positio n of the bulge has
changed.  This  is a relative ly comm on shape,
so for White's play somethin g ordinary  is
likely to be  good e nough.
Solution 1. Kil l with a hane
The simple  hane at Whit e 1 is the killing play
Black  blocks  at 2, and the seque nce continues
with  White's throw- in at 3 a nd pl ay inside at 5. 
In this  position it's necessary  to first exchan ge
Whit e 1 for Black  2. Starting  imm ediately with
the throw-in at 3 ends up failing after Black
captures  at 4.
Solution 2. The  placem ent is the key
In response to White 1, Black  2 is a strange
play;  howev er, White  must  take some  care. So
long  as he is aware of the placeme nt of White 3,
he will be fine. The  seque nce cont inues to 5 . 
White mus t not hastil y play  atari with 3 at 5.
If he does, Black blocks at 3 an d surviv es.
Reference 1. Black is alive
The marked black stone  has been added  to
the problem diagram . If it rema ins White's turn
to play,  can he kill  the Blac k group?
The answer is, if this hane  is present,  Black is
alive. However, if Black  plays  poorly  he still
might  die, so this shape  will be the subject of
some further  investigations.
