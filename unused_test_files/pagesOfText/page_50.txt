Reference 2. Ko is correct
Whit e 1 here  is now the correct  solution.
Black 2 to White 5 produce  a one-step ko for
Whit e. In this shape,  simply  make  note  of the
fact that Black has exactly one liberty on the
outsi de, then compare  it to th e next diagram .
Reference 3. Two liberties
Now there are two liberties on the outside.
Whit e tries playi ng at 1, but, after  White 5,
it's possible to crush  at Black 6.
This shows  that when  Black  has two or
more liberti es on the outs ide, he is uncondi-
tionall y alive.
One-Step Ko
Diagram 1 is a repeat of Reference 2. Afte r
White takes the ko at 1, he has to add one
more  stone at 'a' before it becomes a real ko.
At the point  when Whit e takes at 1, this is
called an appr oach-move  ko. The nature  of
such a ko is such that,  in compariso n to a
real ko, the  burden on Blac k is ligh ter
In Diagram 2, White begi ns a ko fight with
1, but after  this White must still fill in Black-
's liberties at both 'a' and 'b' to make this a
real ko. This is a two- step approach move
ko, which has almost  no effect on Black.
