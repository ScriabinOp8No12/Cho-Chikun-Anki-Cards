Pattern 10
White to p lay, Black d ies
This shape, which looks  as if it might
very well occur  in an actual  game,  can be
considered  a practical appli cation problem.
It's White's turn to play,  but if he makes  a
mistake on the first move, he ends  up in a
maze.  Use what  you have learned  up to this
point.
Solution 1. Att ach and pull back
White should  attach  and pull  back with 1 and
3. If you've  absorbed what's been cove red so
far, then  Black's  death  should  be easy to con-
firm.  The follow-up is shown in the next dia-
gram. 
By the way,  playing atari at 'a' instead  of 3 is
a terrib le mov e.
Solution 2. A fo rmer shape
To continue,  if Black  1, Whit e blocks at 2.
Now  it seems  as if descend ing at 3 is the only
move,  but as we have  already  seen  back  in Pat-
tern 6, in this shape if it's White s turn , Black
dies.  
As before,  White's hane at 4 is good enough.
Whe n Black  blocks at 5, White' s placemen t at 6
kills the group.
Failure. A tr oublesome play
Going back  to the begin ning, while the place-
ment  at White 1 is undeniably also at a vital
point,  after  Black's  block at 2 the situatio n be-
comes  unmanageable. In response  to #, 4 and
6 are tenaci ous. After &, even if Black  simply
connects at 8, his stones  won't die.
