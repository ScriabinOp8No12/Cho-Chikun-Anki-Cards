Variation 2. Simply
In answer  to White  1, seeing that connect-
ing at 2 leave s Black  dead is even  easier.
Once again, White mus t descend  to 3, and
the moves up to White 7 produce a problem-
free shape.
Failure 1. Placement
The placement at White 1 appear s to be an
even  sharper attack. However, Black  defends
at 2 and answers White  3 at 4, leavi ng White
without  any way  to pr oceed.
Whit e 1 looks like the vital point  but gets
Whit e nowh ere. The reason  for this is that
the peculiarities of the corner prevent  White
from  playing 'a'.
Solution 2. Anot her way
Actu ally in this position,  there is one more
correct  solutio n, the attachment  at White  1.
After Black 2, White cuts  at 3 and answers
Black 4 with a han e at 5, produc ing a ko.
It's a splendid tesuji, but based on who
gets to start the ko, Solution 1 is more
favora ble for White.
Failure 2. Unimaginative
It need hard ly be said that blocking with
Whit e 1 is unimag inative. Black  descends at
2 and is allow ed to easily  complete the comb
shape.
