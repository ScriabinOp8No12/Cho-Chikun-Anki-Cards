Pattern 11
White to p lay and make a ko
In this shape, Black has abandoned the
com monse nse play  at 'a' and has played  at
the 2-1 point  in hopes of living. How ever,
he is not alive unco nditionally. By the way
should White push  at 'a , Black  will block at
'b' and live.
Solution 1. The  2-2 poi nt
White attacks  with 1, taking  the other  2-1
point  Black has no choice but to attach  with 2,
and in response to Whit e 3, defend at 4, i nviting
a ko. Should  Black  play  2 at 3, Whit e crawls  at 2
and kills him.
Solution 2. Place ment
The placement at White 1 is also one of the
vital points of this shape. Black's  strongest
resistanc e is the diagona l attachment at 2 In
response  to White 3, Black  cuts White off at 4,
making  a ko. After White captures  at 5, if Black
connects at 'a', Whit e responds  at either 'b' or 'c'
and it's still  a ko.
Solution 3. Att achment
White can also  make the attachment at 1
here.  After  Black 2, he crawls to 3 and answers
4 by turning at 5. Black  is forced  to throw  in at
6, so up to Whit e 7 it's a ko.
Of the three ways of produci ng a ko
discussed  here,  the damage  to White, should he
lose the ko fig ht, is smallest  in Solutio n 1.
