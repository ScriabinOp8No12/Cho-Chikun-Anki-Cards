Pattern 2
Black to play and live
This shape  differs from  the previous  one
in that Black has not extended  all the way  to
the edge of the board. Should  he expand  to
the right or the left?  The situation  requires
that you  exercise  some caution. 
Solution. Descent is the vital point
Black's descent at 1 is an important  play  If
Whit e answers  at 2, then  after  Black 3 we return
to exactly the same 'living' shape  as the previ-
ous pattern.  
Black's descent at 1 is at the vital point  and
makes use of  the specia l nature  of the corner. 
Failure 1. Inad equate space
Crawli ng to the left with Black  1 is rash. Once
Whit e hanes  at the vital point with 2, Black
won't  be able  to live, even by expand ing his
area  with Black  3 to 5. The seque nce continues
to Whit e 8. 
White must  also be careful . If he blocks with
Whit e 2 at 3, h e misses his chance. 
Failure 2. Gree dy
Black's hane at 1 is pointlessly greedy Be-
cause  of this,  White 2, 4, and 6 lead  to a sudd en
and unexpected  death. 
Pay particular attention to the fact that the
hane  at Black 1 versus  the descent  at 4 makes  a
one space  differe nce in the widt h of Black's eye
space.
