Pattern 17
White to p lay, Black d ies
A somewhat  simila r pattern  follo ws.
Black's base seems to have  gotten a bit
broader, but with  White's first move  it'll re-
vert to a  pattern  that  we've alread y seen.
Solution 1. Ha ne
The  ordina ry hane of White  1 is good
enough.  Black  has no choice but to make the
open  connection at 2. After this, White plays
the standard combination of 3 and 5. If Black
plays  6 at 'a', White conn ects at 7, and Black
will be reduced  to a false  eye on the left.
Solution 2. The  tight connection
As another  possib ility, Black could respond
to White's hane at 1 with  the tight connection at
2. How ever, when White craw ls in to 3, this
becomes  a dead shape.
Reference. Ko or death
In this positio n, even if it's White s turn,
Black  is not necessarily dead.  If White blocks  at
'a', Black descends to 'b', and, as we showed
earlier,  this shape becomes  a ko. Therefor e, if
Black,  thinking that he can play  elsewhere here
and get a ko, thoughtlessly exchan ges Black 'a'
for White 'c', he has made his own  group
vuln erable.
