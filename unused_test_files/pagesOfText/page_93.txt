Pattern 25
White to p lay and get a k o
Black's shape is the same as in the solu-
tion to the previous  pattern,  but White  has
descended  all the way  to the edge, so we
can no longer say that Black is alive just as
he is. White should  be careful  about  the se-
lection of his first  play.
Solution 1. Att aching  underneath
White attaches at 1; if Black plays 2, he hanes
at 3. Because  of his shortage of liberties, Black
cannot play at 5, so he makes  another  eye at 4.
Whit e next connects at 5 and Black starts  a ko
fight  with 6.
If Black  uses 4 to captur e at 6, then  after
Whit e 5 and  Black 4, White  will have  the
opportunity  to take the  ko fi rst at 1.
Solution 2. Whit e starts the ko
In response  to White 1, Black can also block
at 2, howev er, after White 3, Black has no
choice but to play  in at 4, so White 5 to 7 pro-
duce  a ko just like before.  Comparing  Black's
positio n here  to the previous diagram,  if he
wins the ko, he will have  more  territory  than
before,  but this time  White can take the  ko first.
Failure. Wrong order
White also gets a ko with  1, but 1 would call
this a failure  because, compared  to the previous
diagram,  Black gets to tak e the ko first.
After Black  4, if White extends  to 'a', it's
possibl e for Black to play elsewhere,  so it
doesn't  simply  revert to th e previous  diagra m.
