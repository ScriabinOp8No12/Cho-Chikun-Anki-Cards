Pattern 15
Black to play and live
Black's shape doesn't  look  very promis-
ing, but it is surprisingly resilient. If he
should miss  playing at the vital point,  how-
ever, he'll die quickly. This is a problem
which vividly demonstra tes the powe r of
the vita l point
Solution 1. Retracting
The vital point  at 1 is Black's only move.
After White confines him with 2, Black makes
an eye with 3. Black  has managed  to live very
efficiently with a minimum  number  of moves.
If White plays  2 at 'a', Black  b' is good
enoug h.
Solution 2. Responding to the place ment
After Black  1, let's consider White's place-
ment at 2 Black  expands his area with the
hane at 3 and after  White  4, simply  descends
to 5. Should White link under at 6, Black will
block at 7.
If White plays 4 at 6, Black again blocks  at
7.
Failure 1. Defensive error
After White's placement  at 2, Black  mus t
not become  flustered and inter cept  at 3. If he
does, Whit e descends  at 4 and Black dies.
Be sure  not to forget that instead  of 3, Black
must play a hane at 4.
