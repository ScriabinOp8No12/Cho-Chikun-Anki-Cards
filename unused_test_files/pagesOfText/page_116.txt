Failure 1. A trap
If White attaches  at 3, is taken  in by
Black's attempt  to confuse  him.  Black
answe rs White 5 with a hane at 6 and has
mana ged to force  a ko.
Besides the attachment, playin g White  3
at 4 is vulgar and also fails. The resulting
position  is the same  as that  in the next
diagra m.
Failure 2. Hane and connection
Going back to the beginning, what about
the hane and conn ection of Whit e 1 and 3?
Natura lly, Black will descend  to 4. In this
position, it looks  as if White  can do
something, but can he really ?
Failure 3. Sell
Lets  try the placeme nt at Whit e 1. Afte r
Black 2, Whi te must  play the attachme nt at
3, but after  Black 4 and Whit e 5, Black can
finally con nect at 6 and  live in seki.
Even if Whit e uses  3 to try the cut at 4,
Black is not short of liberties, so he can atari
at 'a'.
Failure 4. Black is alive
If White makes the placement at 1 on the
right  side, Black  plays the diagonal  attach-
ment  at 2. The fact that Black is alive can be
easily verified.
If Black carelessly  connects with 2 at 'a ,
then  White 'b' and Black  2 result in a ko.
