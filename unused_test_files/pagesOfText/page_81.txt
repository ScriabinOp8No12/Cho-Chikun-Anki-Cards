Pattern 18
White to p lay, Black d ies
Here  we're  going to deal with one of the
variations of the previous pattern  indepen-
dently.  If it's White's turn to play, then
Black is dead . Starting  a ko is the most vul-
gar play  possibl e.
Solution 1. On e-space jump
White s one- space jump  to 1 is clever If you
don't  learn this move,  you cannot capture  the
group  unconditionally. Whe n Black plays 2,
Whit e jumps to 3 and in response  to Black  4,
Whit e plays a hane at 5. This  is not a ko; Black
is dead.
I hope  you can appreci ate the role Whi te 1 is
playi ng in this  positio n.
Solution 2. Place ment at the vital point
If, in response  to White 1, Black  descends to
2, White 3 is the vital  point Whe n Black tries  to
make  an eye with 4, White  5 is a calm  response .
Since 'a and 'b' are now  miai, 'c' will not become
an eye for  Black
Further,  instead  of Black 4 —
Solution 3. Bagging  your catch
Play ing a hane at 1 is a stubborn  play, but
with  the strong  moves  of White 2 and 4, Whit e
will be able to comple te his capture.  Black has
no choice but to connect at 5, so pushing in at 6
is good e nough.
Should White block with 2 at 'a', Black  can
make an  eye at 2 and  persevere  with a ko.
