Failure 1. Descent
White's descent  at 1 is probably the ordi-
nary  approach. If Black  responds  to this by
blocking at 2, then White's place ment at 3
kills him.
Black 2 is unimag inative. Now  both  sides
have  made a mistake.
Failure 2. The difference
In response to White's  descent at 1,
Black's best move is to mak e an eye at 2.
When White slides in to 3, Black  resis ts at 4.
White can play  5, but Black  blocks at 6 and
gets a ko.
You should  be able  to see the differen ce
betwee n this and  havin g White 1 at 'a'.
Failure 3. A dif ferent method
After White 1 and Black 2, White can also
play the attachment at 3. After Black 4 and
White 5, Black throws  in at 6 and once
again  gets a ko.
In either case,  a ko is a failure  for Whit e.
Failure 4. Undistinguished
The most  common mistake for White is
playing the atari at 1. Black will of course
block at 2 and  easily get a ko.
In addition to what  we've covered  thus
far, White  could  play 1 at 'a', but whe n
Black blocks at 'b' and White conne cts at 'c',
Black can live by playi ng 2, so this is
obviousl y a failure for White.
