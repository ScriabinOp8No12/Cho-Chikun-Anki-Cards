Pattern 1
White to p lay, Black d ies
This shape consist s of five stones  lined up
in the corner on the second  line. If it is
White's turn, Black dies; if it is Black's turn,
he can live. This  is one of the basic  life and
death  patterns  in the corner. 
Solution 1. Beginn ing with a hane
White first plays  a hane at 1, then  answers
Black  2 by playi ng inside at 3. Playing a stone
like this inside your  opponents  area after  nar-
rowi ng his base is a basic technique for killing
stones.  
Solution 2. Beginn ing with a place ment
White can also kill the group by begi nning
with  the placement at 1, followed by Black  2
and White 3. 
There  are, in fact, two routes  _ of play,  begi n-
ning with  the hane or the placeme nt You
should  take  careful note,  howev er, of the differ-
ence  betw een these  two  methods. 
Reference. Connect ing to the outside
Suppose  that there were black stones  in the
area  of the two marked  stones . In that case, af-
ter the placement  of Whit e 1, followed by Black
2 and White 3, Black  would  be able to connect
to the outside with 4. Therefor e, White should
play  1 at 2 as in Soluti on 1. Next, Black must
play  'a' and White answers  with 1. Now,  if
Black  captur es at 4, W hite 'b' is good enoug h.
