Pattern 17
White to p lay, Black d ies
This shape  is a little different from  those
we've covered  so far.
Black seems  to be wide  enough  to have
no trouble  living; however, his group has a
fatal defect
Solution. Belly attachment
Beca use the liberties of Black's  two stones
have  been filled in, the belly attachme nt of
Whit e 1 work s well . Black is forced  to connect
at 2, and White links under  with 3. Follo wing
this,  Black  4 to 6 are force d; even  if Black de-
scends  to 'a' after White 7, his positi on is one
line too na rrow to li ve.
Failure. Giving  way
If White plays  a hane at 1, Black  can give way
at 2. If White  3, Black  4 easily  makes  life.
Should  Black carelessly respond  to 2 by playi ng
hane  at 3, W hite cuts  at 2 and  Black dies.
Reference. Black  to live
If it's Black's  turn, he can live by playing  vir-
tually  anywhere,  but the hane  at Black 1 is best
The point is that Black simply needs to defend
against  White 'a , and since  Black 1 has mean-
ing for the endgame, it should  give Black the
greatest  profi t Should  White  play 'b', connect-
ing at 'c' is, of course,  adequate.
