Pattern 13
White to p lay, Black d ies
The positio n has shrunk.  It is of the same
type  as several that have  appear ed so far.
All of Black's outside  libertie s have been
filled in, so he does,  after  all, die unco ndi-
tionally.
Solution 1. Short age of liberties
White 1 is the one and only  weak  point  in
Black's  shape.  If Black answers  at 2, capturing  a
stone  with White 3 and 5 is good  enough.  Black
can't  pres s at 'a' to trap the  white stones  because
of his shortage of liberties.
Solution 2. The  cut
Even if he resists strongly, with Black  2 here,
Whit e has the cut at 3. Once  again a shortage of
liberti es preve nts Black  from play ing atar i at 'a'.
If White tries the attachment  of 'a' instead  of
1, Black makes an ordinary  answer at 1 and
surviv es.
Reference. An ext ra liberty
In this case  there  is an extra  liberty  at 'a'.
Now  Black  answers White 1 at 2 and is alive.
Black  can also answer  White  1 by blocking at 'b'
and,  after White's',  play  Black 2, plan ning to
trap  the white stones  in their  own  shorta ge of
liberti es.
Ultimate ly, the existence  of outs ide liberties
decides  the life or death  of the group.
