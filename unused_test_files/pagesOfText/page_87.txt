Pattern 21
White to p lay and get a k o
This is the position  after Black  has played
the marked stone. If this stone were  not
pres ent, Black  would be alive, but as soon
as he played  this extra stone, he was  no
longer alive unconditionally. How  should
White proceed?
Solution 1. What 's the difference?
The placeme nt at White 1 now  works, and
then  has an oppo rtunity.  In response to Black 2,
Whit e descends to 3. We examined  this se-
quence in the prev ious pattern as well, but
somethi ng is different The continuation after 3
is shown in the next diag ram.
Solution 2. Ko
Black will throw in at 1, then  when White
plays  2, connect at 3. But now  when  White
starts  a ko with 4, Black can no long er plan  to
atari  at 'a'. You  should  be able to see that the
exchan ge of the marked  black and white stones
has created  a shortage  of liberties, which
prevents  Black from playi ng at 'a'.
Solution 3. Sta rting the ko
After White 1 to 3, it should  be noted that it's
better  for Black  to connect at 4. This is because
it forces White  to throw in at 5 and lets Black
take  the ko first In the previous  diagram White
was able  to ca ptur e the ko first.
