Pattern 9
Black to play and live
This is a slight ly troublesome shape. First
you should,  of course,  consider what hap-
pens when  Black  connects his two stones
which are in atari,  but if you decide that
Black cannot  live by playing  that way,
you'l l have to search for a more  efficient
play.
Solution 1. Ret reating
Black 1, retreating to the first line beneath  the
two stones,  is a good,  calm play  Whit e 2 cap-
tures  the two stones,  but that is what Black in-
tends.  The follow-up is shown  in the next  dia-
gram.
Solution 2. Recaptu re
Black recaptur es with 3. After this, Black  an-
swers  White 4 at 5 and White 6 at 7 and barely
lives with the smallest eye spa ce. 
Beca use the first play  was at the vital  point
for making eye shape, and at the same time
made use of  a recaptur e, Black was able  to li ve.
 Failure. Connect ion
In an actual game Black  migh t very well  con-
nect at 1. If he does so, howe ver White hanes  at
the vital point in the corner, and even if Black
craw ls at 3 he doesn't  have the eye space neces-
sary to li ve. The con tinuation is to W hite 6. 
Should Black  begi n by descending with  1 at
2, White, of cour se, captures  at 1 and there is no
way  for Black to liv e.
