Pattern 21
White to p lay, Black d ies
You have to force the marked white stone
to do more than  the ordinary. If the very
first stone  hits the vital point,  Black's  weak
spot will autom atically be expose d.
Solution 1. Turn  under
White 1 occupies  the 2-1 point. After Black 2,
Whit e cuts at 3 and turns  under  at 5. Up to
Whit e 7, the marked  whit e stone has performed
beauti fully. Play ing Whit e 3 at the atari of 6
might  also occur  to you,  but Black  captures  at
'a' and  the mov e fails.
Solution 2. Place ment
If Black  answe rs the atta chment at White 1 by
connecting at 2, White makes the placeme nt at
3. Black  4 is met by White 5, and with 7 this
becomes  a false eye. Addit ionally, if Black
blocks with 4 at 5, Whit e conne cts at 4 and gets
a three- space big eye.
Failure. Lack  of preparation
If White begi ns by cutting  at 1 and then turn s
under  at 3, after Black 4 and White 5, Black  is
able  to make two eyes by play ing at 6. Al-
though  the tesuji of White 1 and 3 is what
you're  aiming at, some  preparation  is necessary
first
