Failure 2. Squeeze play
White conti nues next by filling in a liberty
with 1. Black  captur es a stone,  inviting
White 3. At this point, Black's  throw- in at 4
is a good  move.  Black  answers Whit e 5 by
blocking at 6, yielding a shape  which is not
a ko. You  can probably see that White has
been  squas hed.
Failure 3. Black dies
Black 4 in the previous  diagram is a good
move . If instead Black  descends to 1, as in
this diagram,  after White's hane  at 2, Black is
in trouble. Even  if he plays  atari  at 3, White
blocks at 4 and Black can't play 'a' because  of
his shortage of liberties. This  positio n is bent
four  in the corner.
Failure 4. Ko
This is a variation of the previous
diagra m. After  Black 1 and White 2, Black
has no choice but to fill in his own  liberty at
3 and fight a ko. Whit e 4 and  Black  5
produce  a direct  ko.
Look ing at this shape, you can probab ly
see that Black's original descent to 1 was a
bad play beca use of its effect on the liberties
of his group.
Solution 2. A  separate answ er
After White 1 and Black 2, the vulga r
plays of 3 and 5 also succee d. Black resists
with 6 and 8, captur es the ko wit h 10 at 2 .
In this positio n, if Black should  win the
ko, he captures  at 'a' and takes  profit,  so
Solution  1 is genera lly cons idered to be  best.
