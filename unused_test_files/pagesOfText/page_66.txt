Failure 1. N ot this descent
Lets  investigate  some  other possibi lities.
First  is the descent  at Black 1, but, when
Whit e reduces the black group  with 2 and
4, and Black  plays 5, the white play  at 6
comes  into  the picture.
Not any descent will work: Black 1 is on
the wrong  side.
Failure 2. It 's powe rful, but...
Black  1 certainly looks powerful,  but af-
ter Whit e 2 strikes at the vital  point, Black
cannot make life. After Black 3, White's
hane  at 4 is a calm attack  When Black play s
5, White attaches  at 6, and now  if Black 'a',
Whit e's connection at 'b' prod uces a three-
space  nakade.
Failure 3. One  more vital point
Black's  diagonal  play at 1 is undoubted ly
at one of the vital  points. However , there is
one more vital point  and when  Whit e occu-
pies it with 2, there is no way to live. Even
if Black  descends  at 3, White's extension to
4 makes  this a nakad e. If Black  plays  3 at 4,
Whit e 3 kil ls him.
Failure 4. Reducing
Black  1 also  looks  quite feasi ble. In re-
sponse  to this, White 2, 4, and 6 in order,
narrowi ng Black's area,  is a clever line of at-
tack However, the order of mov es is impor-
tant If instead  of 4, Whit e first throws  in at
6, Black  is able to live with  Black  4, White
'a', Black  'b'.
