Pattern 18
White to p lay, Black d ies
Even as a practi cal application problem,
this is one of the easiest types.  If you' re able
to imagine how the black stones  will look
when lined up on the second line, you'll
prob ably be able to work  out the soluti on.
Solution. The key
If White discovers the attachment at 1,
it's all over.  When  Black plays 2, White
pulls back  at 3 and  it is evident that there  is
no way  for Black to live. Instead  of 2, if
Black hanes on the outsi de at 3, White can
cut at 2.
The key is whether or not you can find
White 1.
Failure 1. Vulgar
The diagona l play of Whit e 1 could  be
played by anybody. If something like this
killed the black group,  there  wouldn't be a
prob lem to solve.  After  Black  2 to Whit e 5,
Black occupies  the vital point at 6 and is
alive.
Note that Black 6 is crucial...
Failure 2. Black's mistake
Black's descent  at 1 comes under  the
heading Black's  mistake'.  After White plays
atari at 2 and Black  3 connects, White  can
force a ko with 4. Notice that Black cannot
squeeze because of a shortage  of liberties.
Instead of connecting at 3, Black can live
by playing 5, but having these three stones
captured is painf ul.
