Pattern 33
Black to play and live
This time Black  has an open liberty on the
roof  of his shape.  This liberty  doesn't seem
to make much  of a differen ce, but in fact it
is very relevant This pattern is a nice little
life and death  problem.
Solution. Whi te can't com e in
Black makes the open connection on the left
side  at 1. When Whit e cuts at 2 it looks as if
Black  is going  to die, but Black has the descent
at 3 to allow  him  to narrow ly escape.  When
Whit e play s 4, Black  descends  at 5. White can't
push  in at 'a'.
Play ing Black  3 at 4 lets White  hane at 3 and
Black  dies.
Failure 2. The  cut
The open conn ection of Black 1 is in the
opposite  direct ion. You  probably rememb er
from  befor e that White will cut at 2, so Black
dies.  The sequen ce continues  up to Whit e 6.
Note  that in the midd le of this sequen ce, Black
cannot use 3 to d escend at 4.
Failure 2. D escent
If Black begins with the descent at 1, White
will play a hane  at 2, then answer Black  3 by
attach ing at 4.
Black also dies if he uses 1 to descend at 2,
since White answers  with the placeme nt at 3.
