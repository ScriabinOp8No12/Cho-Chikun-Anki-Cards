Pattern 20
White to p lay, Black d ies
This is the result after Black ignores  a
white descent  on the left side and plays
elsewhere.  At this point Whit e can use a
technique common  to life and death situa-
tions to kill the black group.  The key is his
first move.
Solution 2. Throw -in
White plays the combination of the throw-
in at 1 and the placeme nt at 3. White 1 re-
duces  Black's eye space,  then  White 3, mak ing
a false  eye out of the left side, is devastati ng.
To see how  Black resists, consi der the next
diagram.
Solution 2. Bent  four  in the corn er
Black's descent  to 1 is met by the white di-
agonal  play  at 2. After  the continuation of
Black  'a', White  b', we have  a bent  four  in the
corner.
Also, even if Black tries to fight  on by play-
ing 'b' in this positio n White plays atari at 'c'
and it's all oven
Failure 1. Fall ing short
The placeme nt at White 1 may  be at the vi-
tal point, but there  hasn't  been  enough  prepa-
ration.  After Black 2, White has no choice but
to narrow  Black's  eye space  by playi ng a hane
at 3, but Black blocks at 4 and White falls just
short  After Black 6, White  'a' is met by Black
'b'.
