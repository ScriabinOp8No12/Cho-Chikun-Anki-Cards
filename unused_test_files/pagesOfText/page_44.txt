Pattern 20
Black to play and live
This is simi lar to the previous  pattern, ex-
cept  that Black has an unfilled liberty  on
one side.  That open liberty is Black's lifeline.
In this  shape, Black can live if it's his turn.
Solution. Eye shape
Black  1, making eye shape, is the vital
point  When  White makes the placement  at
2, Black makes an eye at 3. This time
Whit e's stone cannot  connect to the outside.
The mean ing of the open liberty  at 'a should
be apparent.
Failure 1. Opp osite side
Take  a close look  at the directio n of Black
1 in Solutio n 1. If Black  plays it on the
opposite side,  then  after White's placeme nt
at 2, this shape is dead. When  Black tries  to
make an eye at 3, White will cut at 4. In this
diagram,  Black  doesn't  make use of the
open  liberty
Failure 2. Descent
What  about  Black's  descent at 1? Unfortu-
nately White 2 turn s out to be at the vital
point  Black  cannot  live. If Black  cont inues
by descendi ng at 'a', Whit e can play
elsewhere. Next, ' b' and 'c' are miai.
If White make s the mistake  of playing 2
on the wrong side, at 'c', Black can play  at 2
and live.
