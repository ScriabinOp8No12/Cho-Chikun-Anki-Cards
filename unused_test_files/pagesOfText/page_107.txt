Pattern 8
White to p lay, Black d ies
The basic pattern  of the eight-space  shape
has been comple ted, but the foot of it is still
open. Moreov er, the fact that there is a
shortage  of liberties problem  means that if
White plays  first,  Black  will not be able to
survive.
Solution 2. Hane and connection
With the hane  at 1 and connection at 3,
Whit e kills the black group.  Black  descends to
4 and it seems  as if he has enough eye-space
to live, but there is a serious defe ct in his
shape. White's next  play is a standard
techn ique of life and death.
Solution 2 Placement
Whit e's placemen t at 1 is a strong play
Whe n Black blocks at 2, White  cuts at 3, and,
beca use of his shortage  of liberties, Black can-
not atari the white stones.
If Black makes the diagona l attachme nt at
'a inste ad of 2, White connects underneath at
2 and it's all over
Failure. Resp onse to the hane
If White doesn't know about  the placement
at 1, Black  will be able  to survi ve. For exam-
ple, in answer  to a white hane  at 1, Black
blocks at 2, then,  even  if White cuts at 3, Black
simply  captur es at 4, leaving White  with no
way  to con tinue.
Even  if Whit e begi ns with the placement  at
'a', B lack play s 2 and is aliv e.
