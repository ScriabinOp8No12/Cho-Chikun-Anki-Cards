Solution 2. Whit e play s a hane
After Black's  diagona l play  at 1, if White
plays  a hane  at 2, living is simple. Follo w-
ing Black  3 and White 4, Black can force
with  5 and  make life by descending at 7.
Even  if Black makes the empt y triang le
shape  at 5 first, he still cannot be kept from
living.
Failure 3. H one and connect
If Black  begins  by playi ng hane  and con-
nectio n at 1 and 3, he makes a shape  which
is no longer alive. White will respond  with
the hane and connection at 4 and 6, and
Black  cannot get enough  spac e to m ake lif e.
Instead  of 4, White can also simply de-
scend  to 6.
Failure 4. Ko
What  about  if Black begins with the hane
at 1 and then  steps down  to 3? While Black
1 looks  to be a produc tive move,  it's actual-
ly a poor  play. When  White plays atari at 4,
Black  is forced  to block at 5 and all he gets
is a ko.
Failure 5. A super fluous play
After Black 1 to White 4 of the previous
diagram,  lets take a look at what  happens  if
Black  tries the technique of Solutio n 1, by
playi ng 5 and 7. Unfortunately, this time
Whit e has the attachme nt at 8, so Black
ends  up d ead.
Black  1 turns out to have been  superflu-
ous.
