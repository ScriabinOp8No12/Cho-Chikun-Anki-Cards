Failure 1. The other placement
Whit e's placement at 1 is another  vital
point,  but wi ll it kill the black group?
If Black connects at 2, White blocks at 3.
Whe n Black descends to 4, White hanes at 5.
At this point Black is dead.
However, Black has made a mistake  in this
diagram.
Failure 2. Alive
In response  to White 1, Black must  mak e
the diagona l play at 2 This  is after all the true
vital point
Whit e has no choice but to block  at 3, so
Black makes an eye at 4. Black  has once  again
been saved by the liberty at 'a'.
Failure 3. Blocking outside
As we said at the outs et, blocking on the
outsi de with  White 1 lets Black  play at the vi-
tal point with  2 and live.
You mustn't  forget  that  there  is a weakness
in the base  of Black's positio n.
Failure 4. Hane
How about  Whit e's hane  at 1? Here, too,
Black plays at 2 and  lives. White's  only
continuation  seems to be 'a', but Black blocks
at 'b' and is alive.
Should  Black  block with 2 at 'b', White  can
play  at 2 and kill him.
