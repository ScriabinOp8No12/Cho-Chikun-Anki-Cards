Pattern 4
White to p lay, Black d ies
This time White  has descended  to the
edge of the board on the right This descent
is even  more  pow erful than  the prev ious
one,  so if Whit e plays first,  he has more
than  one way  of killing Black Regardless,
Black's problem  will be his shortage  of liber-
ties.
Solution 1. Un able to press
First  is White's placeme nt at 1. After Black 2,
the cutti ng plays  of White 3 to 5 are splendid.
Even  though  Black  tries to resist with 6 to get a
ko, when  White  plays  at 7, Black's shor tage of
liberti es make it impossi ble for him to atari on
the white stones.
Alternatively, instead  of 5, Whi te 7, Black  5,
Whit e 6 would make a fiv e-space big eye.
Solution 2. Begin  with the turn
Turni ng at White 1 combi ned  with the
placeme nt at 3 is another  method of killing the
black group.  When Black  conn ects at 4, White 5
and 7 produce  a five-space  big eye.
In this case,  howe ver, if White should  make
his place ment at 5 instead of 3, Black will play
at the vital point  with  3 and live. If White wants
to play  5, he  must d o it before he plays  at 1.
Solution 3. Short age of liberties
After White 1 to 3, turning at Black  4 is a
strong  move , but once  again  Black  is plagued
by a shortage of liberties. White  hanes  at 5, then
cuts  at 7. If he wishes,  White can reverse  the
order  of 5 and 7, since , even  if Black  answers  7
at 'a', White 5 still punishes Black for his short-
age of  liberties.
