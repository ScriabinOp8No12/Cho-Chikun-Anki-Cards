Variation 4. A struggl e
Whit e has to capture  at 9, but after this
Black  can recapture  two whit e stones  by
playi ng one space  below 9. Next, White  also
recaptures  with 11 at 9, and we mov e to the
next  diagram.
Variation 5. D ouble ko
Conti nuing from the last diagram, Black
connects at 12 White has to fill in an outs ide
liberty at 13, and Black  captures  at 14. This
shape  is a doubl e-ko, so it's alive. Even  if
Whit e eliminates all possible ko threats be-
fore  recaptur ing at 14, Black can simply
take the  ko on  the other side  at 'a'.
Failure 1. N egligence
After White 1 to 3,  playi ng atari at Black 4
is a blu nder After White connects at 5, Black
has no choice but to secure  his base with 6.
Whit e 7 forces Black 8 and White  fills in an
outside  liberty at 9. Afte r Black takes the
four stones with 10...
Failure 2. Ko
Whit e has the attachment at 11. Black is
forced  to play 12, and with  13 White gets a
ko.
In this pattern, the path  leading to the
double  ko is interesting, and worth  revie w-
ing at least once more.
