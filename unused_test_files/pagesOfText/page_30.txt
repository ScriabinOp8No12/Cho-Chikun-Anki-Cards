Failure 2. Ko
Black has no choice but to throw in at 5 and
ends  up w ith a ko. 
Now,  just for the sake of clarity, the presence
of the marked white stone does  have an impact
on the life or death  of the black group.  To see
what  would  happen  if this stone were  not
present,  see the  next diagram.
Reference 1. Sque eze play
After the prev ious diagram,  Black captur es at
1. If White is forced  to play  a defensive move  at
2, then  Black, who  still has an unfilled liberty
on the outs ide, can aim at a squeeze  play  with
Black  3. 
In either case, howe ver, living as in Solutio n
2 must be  consi dered  a loss . 
Solution 3. A lo ss
Black 1, at the vital point  for making eye
shape,  is a tight  way of living. Black no longer
need  be concer ned about  living, but compared
to Solutio n 1, he has suffered  as much  as a two-
point  loss. 
Reference 2. Whi te to play Black dies
Just as a referen ce, should  Black play  else-
where  in the original diag ram, so that White
gets to make the first move here,  natural ly there
is no way  for him to live. Whit e narrows  Black's
eye space with 1 and 3, then  plays inside at 5.
Black  is clearly dead.
