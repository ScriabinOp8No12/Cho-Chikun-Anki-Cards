Pattern 16
White to p lay, Black d ies
White's descent  on the right  side will
make  its presence felt. The point  here  is
whether  or not you can hit the mark with
your  first  move. The details  which follo w
are merely icing on the cake.
Solution 1. Contact  play inside
It's the conta ct play  inside at White  1 or noth-
ing. This is the only poss ibility for Black  2, since
if Black plays atari  at 3 instead,  White  descend s
at 2, and if Black  5, White 'a'. In either  case
Black  is easily  killed. Next, White extends  with
3 and, when Black  plays 4, cuts  at 5. After
B1ack's  forced  captur e at 6...
Solution 2. False eye
The throw-in at Whit e 7 makes  this a false
eye. The marked white  stone has really  done its
work.
By the way, within this series of moves, there
is one easy mis take to m ake.
Failure 1. Cutt ing on the wrong  side
After White 1 through  Black 4, if White care-
lessly  cuts underneat h at 5, the stron g play  at
Whit e 1 comes  to nothi ng. Black  can simply
connect at 6. The two white stones  are captured
as they  are, and there  is no way  to make  it a
false  eye.
