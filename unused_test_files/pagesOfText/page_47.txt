Pattern 22
Black to play and live
This is the most abbreviated  Black  shape
so far, but the principle is the same, Black  to
play and live. There is only  one vital point
Solution. The same move
Once again, making eye shape  at Black  1
is the key White has to play  at 2, but whe n
Black descends  at 3, he is alive.
Obv iously if White plays  2 at 3, then  Black
2.
Failure 1. Impu lsive
Wha t Black  has to take care  of is not to
crawl impulsively at 1. It seems  as if he s ex-
panding his eye spac e, but the instant  he
plays it, he loses  all hope  of living.
Whe n Black  plays  5, White cuts at 6, and
Black's shortage  of liberties kills him.
Failure 2. Different directi on
Black 1 makes eye space  in the oppos ite
directi on. White play s 2 at the origi nal vital
point Because this gives rise to the cut at 'a',
Black doesn't  have enough room to live.
