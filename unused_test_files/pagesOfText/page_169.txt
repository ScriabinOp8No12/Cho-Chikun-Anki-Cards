Pattern 22
White to p lay, Black d ies
Making do with the hane of the marked
black stone  is not the same  as the real thing.
How should  White take advan tage of Black-
's thinness? This is a tough  prob lem finding
the first  move  may be qu ite difficult.
Solution 1. Place ment
The placemen t of White 1 is at the vital
point  Recognizing that this is also  where
Black  would  play if he were  going to try
and live here  is a clue  to locati ng it For
example,  if White were  to hane  with 1 at 'a',
Black  would make  the open conne ction at 1
and live.
For the possib le variat ions, consider the
diagrams  which follo w.
Solution 2. An im portant hane
If Black  answers  White's placement by
connecting at 1, naturall y, White extends to
2. If Black continues by connecting at the
bottom with 3, the hane  at 4 and atari at 6
are an important  sequen ce. After  this,  if
Black  captures  at 'a', White extends  again to
'b' and  makes a th ree-spac e big  eye.
Failure 1. Unp repared
After Black 1 and 3, extend ing to 4 imme-
diately  has to be called careless. By taking a
breather  at this point,  you allow him to play
at 5 and  live.
Black can also live by desce nding to 'a' in-
stead of  5.
